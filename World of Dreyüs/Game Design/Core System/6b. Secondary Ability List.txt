Manipulative Duelist
--
Req: Master Melee Weapons
Cost:

This ability gives you access to the Unbalancing Strike and the Disarming Strike Techniques.

Unbalancing Strike
-
This Technique allows you to choose to deal less damage with a successful Melee Weapons Attack and instead force the target into
provoking an Opening. 
Once per round, you may choose up to two successful dice rolled for a Melee Weapons Attack to deal 0 Damage. If you do so, the target
provokes an Opening where the number of Action Points that can be spent are equal the number of dice used for this effect (maximum 2).
Any dice used to activate this effect cannot count as successful dice for any other effect.

Disarming Strike (Attack)
-
This Technique allows you to launch a special attack with the goal of forcing your target to drop their weapons.
You cannot use this Attack Action if you current Potential for a Melee Weapons (Finesse + Power) roll is less than 3.
You may expend 2 Action Points to make a Melee Weapons Attack against a target you can see within range and use at least 3 dice
in the roll for the attack.  
This Attack Action requires you to succeed on an least 3 dice, and provoke no Openings, otherwise it fails. 
If successful, this attack forces the target to forced to let go of any weapons they are holding,  which then drop to the ground at 
their feet. If your hands are free enough to hold any of the weapons that would be dropped, you may choose to take them instead of 
letting them fall to the ground. 
Any successful dice after the 3 used to trigger the disarming effect may be used to inflict Damage or trigger some other effect, 
however the primary 3 dice cannot be counted for Damage or any other effects.

Conditioned Fighter
--
Req: Journeyman Hand-to-Hand, Journeyman Kinesiology
Cost:

This ability affects your Throw, Restrain, and Pin Techniques from the Hand-to-Hand Ability. 
You can now perform these Techniques by expending 1 Action Point, instead of 2. 
Additionally, you may expend 2 Action Points immediately after succesfully attacking with your Throw, Restrain, or Pin Technique to
make a regular Hand-to-Hand attack against the same target. (Note: your target does not need to fail any saves inflicted by your
successful attack in order to trigger this effect. You only need to succeed on the initial Technique attack.)


\\\


Masterful Discipline
--
Req: Master Hand-to-Hand
Cost:

This ability passively reduces the Stress you recieve, a result of your extensive internal reflection in combination with the 
physicaly commitment to your training. While some may achieve martial mastery through physical effort alone and never achieve this
inner resilience, this ability represents those who have dedicated themselves to a more complete mastery of the self, extending to
both the mental and physical.
 
Whenever your Stress would increase from any source, your Stress instead only increases by half the normal amount, rounded up.

Microfabricator-Weapon Integration (M-fab)
--
Req: Battletech Class, Journeyman Engineering, Journeyman Marksmanship OR Journeyman Melee Weapons. 
Cost:
Learning this ability locks a character out of learning the Microfabricator Advanced Cooling System Secondary Ability.

You spend time fabricating and modifying your m-fab and your chosen weapon, combining to the two in order to streamline your use
of both on the battlefield. You can use a pre-existing weapon you possess, or fabricate a new one of your choice if you are able,
however the weapon must be of a type governed by the Primary Ability you used to meet the requirement for this Secondary Ability.

Your new hybrid m-fab/weapon starts with Journeyman Quality, and can be upgraded by you as you progress your Engineering Ability.

Whenever you make an attack using the m-fab component of your weapon, you may expend 1 Action Point immediately after and make a
normal (non-Technique) attack against a target you can see using the weapon Primary Ability governing your weapon. 

You gain one of two additional benefits depending on what kind of weapon you create:
- If you create a melee weapon, you can perform your m-fab attack actions as melee weapon attacks, and use Power + Acuity as the 
	Potential for the roll instead of the normal Attributes for that attack whenever you do so. Using m-fab attacks this way
	cannot bypass the Cooldown requirements inflicted by those Techniques.
- If you create a ranged weapon, any ranged m-fab attack actions you can perform have their maximum range doubled.

Microfabricator Advanced Cooling System (M-fab)
--
Req: Battletech Class, Journeyman Engineering, Thermals Expert (Secondary Ability) 
Cost:
Learning this ability locks a character out of learning the Microfabricator-Weapon Integration Ability.

You research and design a new custom housing for your microfabricator that features a robust cooling system. With the appropriate 
materials and time you can build the device, reconfiguring an m-fab core into the new device. Despite the increase in overall bulk,
your modified microfabricator can sustain higher rates of production and emission without damaging the systems.

Your new m-fab starts with Journeyman Quality, and can be upgraded by you as you progress your Engineering Ability.

When wielding a MACS m-fab, you may use two m-fab actions with the Cooldown tag during a turn, rather than one. If you've made no 
other attack actions during a turn, one or both of m-fab actions can be attack actions.

- The time it takes for you to manufacture any equipment or consumable is halved.
- If you are crafting an item related to another Primary Ability you possess (such as weapons or medicinal drugs) and the associated
	Primary Ability is a higher Ability Level than your Engineering Ability, you may use the other Primary Ability instead of 
	Engineering for rolls made for crafting the item. If you do so, the items Quality Level is determined by the alternate 
	Primary Ability instead of your Engineering Ability. Rolls made this way can benefit from your Expertise Technique if you
	gain Master Engineering.
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any Ability Roll related to knowledge concerning manufacturing and materials. This
	modifier cannot stack with any other modifier provided by Engineering or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities.

role. This modifier cannot stack with any other modifier provided by Engineering or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities.


\\\


Microfabricator Combat Drone (M-fab)
--
Req: Battletech Class, Master Engineering, Fabrication Expert (Secondary Ability)
Cost:

You spend time designing and fabricating a custom drone system, decoupling your m-fab's user interface from the core to allow the 
latter to serve as the heart of the drone, and linking the systems together via radio to allow the user interface to serve as the 
remote control. The new microfabricator-bearing drone can serve as your proxy during combat, allowing you to extend your presence on
the battlefield without incurring additional risk to yourself. The drone is terrestial, but can traverse most surfaces.


(Optional Rule: you and your GM can discuss the specific design of the drone, adjusting its situational capability to match its 
unique features if your GM thinks it appropriate. Think of the following as suggestions for roleplay, rather than stone-set rules.
You could take inspiration from the following, or work out the specifics of your own creative vision. As always, try to keep game
balance in mind, any specific design should have strengths and weaknesses that account for capability and cost.

For instance, the simplest, cheapest drones might use wheels or tracks, sacrificing enviromentally-specific capabilities for easier 
availability as well as decent ground-pressure distribution that allows for a jack-of-all-trades approach that can handle reasonable
amounts of harzards such as mud, ice, and sand roughly equally.

Drones with powerful, surface-piercing legs might have incredible climbing capabilities and handle uneven or broken surfaces well,
but may suffer from mechanical complexity as well as high ground-pressure that makes them less reliable on many surfaces. They might
bog down in bad conditions and be more expensive to repair when disabled. 

Ground-effect or Lift-Drive motivated drones would be very costly to create and maintain, but could effectively ignore enviromental 
variability, limited only by the incline of the surface itself. These drones cannot truly fly, and are thus unable to traverse 
in the vertical extreme. They are unlikely to suffer in performance until disabled completely, but their monolithic design makes them
more costly to repair in comparison to modular designs that allows for individual pieces, such as wheels, tracks or leg-segments to
be replaced instead of the entire apparatus.

In terms of game mechanics, the drone could be forced to make saves or rolls to traverse unfavorable terrain, and/or suffer movement
value penalties. Some drones would be able to move in ways others cannot, and some designs may suffer drom Damage in different ways.
They might have small variations in their Attributes and abilities. Material expense should also vary based on capability and a 
sense of technological scaling. Your GM can set a common set a rules, or choose to rule dynamically based on the specific scenario 
that you have collaborated to create.)


The drone acts directly through your commands, which you give through the controller you carry on your person. The drone can receive 
commands from up to 1km away. If the drone leaves the 1km range, it will attempt to execute the last command given before attempting 
to reestablish connection by returning to the last position it was at when it received a command. The drone will stay in this holding
position until the connection returns and a new command is given. The drone is small enough to be carried by one individual, but is
likely heavy enough to affect the movement anyone attempting to do so (~30-40 kilos). 

The drone has its own stat block, but derives some of its non-physical Attributes from your own. Additionally, it does not follow the
standard rules for basic actions, including movement, or the rules for Damage and Stress. These are instead governed by special rules
specific to the drone. 

You can only ever deploy and control one drone at a time, however you could theoretically craft and store additional copies as a 
reserve in the event of a complete loss.

M-fab Drone
-
H: 2 | T: - | S: 4 | F: 4 | A: X | P: 3 | C: - | M: X |

Values marked with an "X" use your value for that Attribute.

Health: 20
Control: -
Defense: 6
Passive Perception: Uses yours
Movement Value: 4m
AP: the drone cannot act on its own, instead requiring you to expend your own Action Points to issue various commands.
Carry Weight: The drone cannot carry objects beyond its integrated equipment, but can exert enough extra force readily free itself
	from roughly 30 kilos of force inhibiting it, such as fallen debris. 
Cost: The cost of the materials to build the drone represented as an amount of Credits. 


Mechanical: the drone is immune to Stress, and reacts differently to Damage.
	Degraded: Applied when Damage increases and the result is equal to or higher than the drone's Health. 
		The drone has -1 Potential on all actions while Degraded.
		The Degraded Status is removed automatically if the drone's Damage is lowered and the result is less than the drone's 
		Health.
	Disabled: Applied when Damage increases and the result is equal to or higher than twice the drone's Health.
		The drone cannot perform any actions, including movement, while Disabled. Additionally, its Defense becomes 1.
		The Disabled Status is removed automatically if the drone's Damage is lowered and the result is less than twice the
		drone's Health.
	Destroyed: Applied when Damage increases and the result is equal to or higher than three times the drone's Health.
		The drone is near-completely demolished, and requires a total rebuild or replacement to return to service.
	Non-biologic: The drone cannot benefit from healing sources designed for living beings, instead requiring material servicing.
		The Medicine Primary Ability cannot heal the drone, and actions and consumables such as the Combat Regeneration
		Technique and Regen-Stims do not affect the drone.

Move: You can expend 1 AP and order the drone to move a number of meters up to twice its movement value.

M-fab use: Whenever you perform an action using your m-fab, you expend the normal amount of AP for that action and issue a command
	to your drone to carry out the act. Additionally, the drone can move a number of meters up to its movement value whenever 
	you issue a command in this way. The drone performs any rolls required by the action, using its own Attribute values but
	relying on your relevant Ability Level. 

M-fab resupply: You may expend 1 AP to have the drone restore the Material Pool of the integrated m-fab.
	The drone can carry a number of resupply pods equal to its Power Attribute, and must be manually restocked once they are
	expended.

Field Repair: You may expend 2 AP to have the drone diagnose and self-repair using its m-fab. Its uses your Engineering Ability Level
	for this roll, however the Potential is determined by the amount of Material you choose to expend. For every 5 Material you
	choose to use, the Potential increases by 1. You must always expend at least 5 Material to have the minimum 1 Potential for 
	roll, and you can expend no more than 25 Material to achieve the maximum 5 Potential.
	
	This action has the M-fab and Cooldown Tags, and prevents the drone from expending further Material during that turn.
	
	The threshold for this roll is always 3, and the drone's Damage is reduced by an amount equal to the combined value of all
	successful dice. Additionally, the Degraded and Disabled Statuses are removed if any number of dice succeed, regardless of 
	the drone's total Damage. 

Maintenance: Outside of combat you can repair the drone directly if you have access to sufficient tools and supplies.
	You can spend half a day's work and use materials equal to half the Cost of the drone to remove an amount of Damage equal to 
	twice the drone's Health.
	You can spend a whole day's work and use materials equal to the Cost of the drone to remove all Damage from the drone and
	remove the Destroyed Status.
	
Rebuild: If the drone is completely lost you may build a new one from scratch.
	You spend a day and half's work and use materials equal to the Cost of the drone to reconstruct the complete device.



The drone can gain additional benefits from advancing your Engineering Primary Ability, as well as some Secondary Abilities:

Attribute Improvement: Your drone's Attributes increase if you become a Legend Engineer.
	The drone's Heartiness, Speed, Finesse, and Power increase by 1, and the related Derived Stats (Health, Defense, etc.)
	increase accordingly.
	
Weapon Integration: you can equip your drone with a normal weapon if you have the Microfabricator-Weapon Integration Ability.
	The drone is equipped with a small or large weapon corresponding to the type governed by the Primary Ability used to unlock
	the Microfabricator-Weapon Integration Ability (either ranged for Marksmanship or melee for Melee Weapons).
	The drone's weight and cost should increase as a result of this addition.
	You can expend the regular amount of AP required to make an attack with weapon, ordering the drone to carry out the act
		instead. Additionally, the drone can move a number of meters up to its movement value whenever you issue a command 
		in this way.
	The drone also benefits from all the features of the Microfabricator-Weapon Integration Ability.
	If your drone would perform an attack and an m-fab action in one turn, it can only benefit from the additional movement one
		time.

MACS Integration: your drone can be equipped with a MACS m-fab, if you have the Microfabricator Advanced Cooling System Ability.
	The drone's weight and cost should increase from the addition of the MACS system.
	Your drone gains all the benefits of the Microfabricator Advanced Cooling System Ability.
	If your drone would perform two m-fab actions in one turn, it can only benefit from the additional movement one time. 

Armor Integration: If you have the Armorer Ability you may craft and equip armor to your drone.
	The drone's weight and cost should increase from the addition of the armor. 
	Your drone can benefit from the Ablative Shield Technique.

Mechanist: The benefits from the Fabrication Expert Ability, if you have it, apply to the creation and maintenance of your drone
	outside of combat.

Experienced Repair: If you have the Combat Mechanic Ability, your drone's Field Repair action gains the following benefits.
	The minium Potential for the roll becomes 2, however the minimum cost remains 5 Material.
	Additional Potential after the first 2 still costs an extra 5 Material per dice.
	The maxium Material that can be expended is 20 for 5 Potential, and the minimum is 5 Material for 2 Potential.

Medical Drone: your drone can perform m-fab actions related to the Medicine Primary Ability if you have the Microfabricator
	Physician Ability. It can perform specific actions granted by Techniques, as well as generic Medicine Ability Rolls that
	make use of the m-fab.

Armorer
--
Req: Novice Engineering
Cost:

This ability represents specialized knowledge in the design and construction of protective armor and shielding. 
You gain the following benefits after acquiring this ability:
- You may use your Engineering Primary Ability to craft body armor (see Section 7. Item System) if you have access to a workstation, 
	as well as sufficient time and resources. You may craft armor for individuals other than yourself as well, however the armor 
	must be sized to each individual. 
- If you gain Master Engineering you may use the benefit from your Expertise ability when making any Ability Rolls related to this 
	Secondary Ability. 
	(Note: there is no Primary Ability related to armor, so Expertise would never affect armor-related rolls normally.)
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any Ability Roll related to knowledge concerning protective armors and shieldings.
	This modifier cannot stack with any other modifier provided by Engineering or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities.
- You gain access to the Ablative Shield Technique.


Ablative Shield (M-fab)
-
This Technqiue allows you to apply a temporary one-use coating to your or another individual's armor, boosting its effectiveness.
You may expend 1 AP and 5 Material, targeting youself or an individual within arm's reach, and use your m-fab to spray a material
across the surface of the target's armor that instantly forms a hardened layer.
This layer of shielding increases the target's Armor Mitigation against all attacks by an amount determined by your Engineering
Ability Level, and is described by the following table:
	------------------------------
	| Ability Level |   Amount   |
	|---------------|------------|
	|    Novice	|      1     |
	|  Journeyman	|      2     |
	|    Master     |      3     |
	|    Legend     |      4     |
	------------------------------ 	

This effect ends after the target is hit by an attack that deals Damage, or after 5 rounds, at which point it readily sheds off with
negligible energy.
This Technique cannot not be applied to a character affected by the Inflamed Status.


\\\


Explosives Expert
--
Req: Journeyman Engineering
Cost: 

This ability represents specialized experience and knowledge in the field of explosive materials and devices. 
You gain the following benefits after acquiring this ability:
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any Abiltiy Roll related to knowledge concerning explosives. This modifier cannot 
	stack with any other modifier provided by Engineering or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities.
- You gain access to the Blast and Micro-Grenade Techniques


Blast (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown, Energy-Based Attack)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a projectile composed of powerful high explosives directly 
onto a target.
You may expend 2 AP and 5 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against one target you can see within 50m using 
Engineering (Finesse + Acuity).
The projectile from this attack is very fragile, and explodes on contact, requiring you to have a direct angle to the target.
The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended for
rest of the turn.


Micro-Grenade (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a small airburst grenade composed of fragible material and 
high explosives.
You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against each target within a 5m diameter sphere centered at a spot
of your choice within 50m using Engineering (Finesse + Acuity). You make only one roll for this attack, but compare the results
against each of the targets' Defense values individually to determine success.
Targets hit by this attack take Damage equal to half the value of the successful dice, rounded down. 
If the trajectory of the grenade is blocked before it reaches its target point it may deflect, bounce, roll, or drop before 
detonating before the end of the action.
The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended for
rest of the turn.


\\\


Thermals Expert
--
Req: Journeyman Engineering
Cost:

This ability represents specialized experience and knowledge in the field of thermal engineering. 
You gain the following benefits after acquiring this ability:
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any Ability Roll related to knowledge concerning topics within thermal engineering.
	This modifier cannot stack with any other modifier provided by Engineering or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities.
- You gain access to the Ignite and Freeze Techniques.


Ignite (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown, Energy-Based Attack)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a small container of incendiary material and flammable adhesive 
fluid.
You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against one target you can see within 50m using 
Engineering (Finesse + Acuity). 
The projectile from this attack is very fragile, and explodes on contact, requiring you to have a direct angle to the target.

If the attack is successful, the target is inflicted with the Inflamed Status in addition to the normal Damage inflicted.
The "Statuses" section describes the rules for the Inflamed Status.
The Damage caused by this Inflamed Status, as well as the duration of the effect, is determined by your Engineering Ability Level and 
is described by the following table:
	-------------------------------------
	| Ability Level | Damage | Duration |
	|---------------|--------|----------|
	|  Journeyman	|  2d4   | 3 Turns  |
	|    Master     |  3d4   | 4 Turns  |
	|    Legend     |  4d4   | 5 Turns  |
	-------------------------------------
Damage from the Inflamed Status is dealt at the start of the target's turn, and ends automatically after dealing Damage on the last 
turn of its duration. Damage from the Inflamed Status is not affected by Armor Mitigation.
The Inflamed Status can be ended early via a successful Extinguish Save, as described in the "Statuses" section.

The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended for
rest of the turn.


Freeze (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown, Energy-Based Attack)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a small container of cryogenic material and a thermally 
superconductive adhesive. 
You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against one target you can see within 50m using 
Engineering (Finesse + Acuity).
The projectile from this attack is very fragile, and explodes on contact, requiring you to have a direct angle to the target.

If the attack is successful, the target is forced to make a special Injury Save in addition to receiving the normal Damage inflicted.
If the target fails on every dice for the Injury Save (i.e. roll higher than their Heartiness Attribute on every dice), they suffer 
an Injury due to the extreme freezing effect. The number of d6 dice used for this special Injury Save is determined by your 
Engineering Ability Level and is described by the following table:
	-------------------------------
	| Ability Level | Injury Save |
	|---------------|-------------|
	|  Journeyman	|     3d6     |
	|    Master     |     2d6     |
	|    Legend     |     1d6     |
	------------------------------- 
If the target fails the Injury Save inflicted by this Technique and you do not provoke any Openings or Mistakes during the attack,
you may choose what body part receives the Injury. If an Opening or Mistake was provoked, the Injury is applied to random body part.
(Note: The GM can choose what the Injury is, or have the player roll 1d6 and use that result to determine what part is injured.)

The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a

Surgeon
--
Req: Novice Medicine
Cost:

This ability represents specialized experience and knowledge in the general use of surgical intervention in a medical context.
Surgical expertise is invaluable to sky-ship crews, as the potential for intense physical trauma is high and surgeons are often 
responsible for the preservation of life and limb.
You gain the following benefits after acquiring this ability:
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any Ability Roll related to referencing or employing surgical techniques. This 
	modifier cannot stack with any other modifier provided by Medicine or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities, except for

Microfabricator Physician
--
Req: Journeyman Medicine
Cost:

You've learned how to apply some of the essential functions of microfabricators within a medicial context, allowing you to utilize
an m-fab when using your Medicine Primary Ability. Common applications include the use of the m-fab's material analysis capabilities 
for diagnostics, and the immediate production and application of medicines, especially ones that are too unique or unstable to 
reliably carry. Other Medicine-dependent Secondary Abilities grant more advanced medicial m-fab Techniques that can only be used 
if the character knows this ability as well.

Additionally, after acquiring this ability you gain the following benefits:
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice whenever you are attempting to use your Medicine Primary Ability to medically diagnose a
	target, if you can make use of an m-fab while doing so.
- When using your Stabilzie Technique you can choose to expend 5 Material from your m-fab, doing so causes the Technique to succeed
	automatically without requiring the Treatment Save and immediately apply the Stabilzied Status to the target.
- You gain access to the Combat Regeneration Technique.


Combat Regeneration (M-fab, Healing, Cooldown)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab to treat wounds on yourself or another individual.
You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a Medicine (Acuity + Memory) roll targeting yourself or another individual within arm's
reach. The target threshold for this roll is 3, and the target's Damage is reduced by a value equal to the sum of all successful dice.
Damage cannot be reduced below 0, and the roll for this action cannot benefit from any Roll or Effect Modifiers.
If an individual is healed by any combination of Regen-Stims and/or the Combat Regeneration Technique more than once a day, they 
receive an amount Stress equal to 6 minus their Tenacity each time they are healed after the first.
The effect of this Technique is blocked by the Toxified Status (see Section 5. Statuses).

Generating a strong dose requires pushing the core of the m-fab over a short period, causing it to generate extra heat, and requires 
a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for 
any action that requires Material to be expended for rest of the turn.

Psychologist
--
Req: Journeyman Medicine, Novice Communication
Cost: 

This ability represents specialized experience and knowledge in the communication-based medical care of an individual's mental health.
Stress management capabilities can be invaluable both in and out of combat, allowing allies to recover from stress faster and be less
likely to hesitate during critical moments.
You gain the following benefits after acquiring this ability:
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any Ability Roll related to referencing or employing psycological techniques. This 
	modifier cannot stack with any other modifier provided by Medicine or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities, except for
	the bonus provided by the Microfabricator Physician Secondary Ability.
- You gain access to the Therapist and Bolster Techniques.


Therapist
-
This Technique provides a passive benefit to you and your allies. You've taken to incorporating subtle therapeutic methods into your
everyday interactions with the crew. These efforts help to ensure a healthy enviroment that allows crewmates to more easily process
the Stress of their adventures.

Whenever you and your allies roll to reduce Stress after resting you may roll an additional die and increase the value by that amount.
The size of the additional die is determined by your Ability Level in Communication. 
	------------------------
	- Ability Level | Size -
	----------------|-------
	-    Novice	|  d6  - 
	-  Journeyman	|  d8  -
	-    Master	|  d10 -
	-    Legend	|  d12 - 
	------------------------


Bolster
-
This Technique allows you to expend 1 AP to target yourself or any individual you have some means of direct communication with.
Until the end of their current turn, or their next turn if it is not currently their turn, the target ignores the -1 Potential 
penalty from the Shaken Status, and may reroll one dice rolled for a Panic Save.

Anaesthesiologist
--
This ability represents specialized experience and knowledge in the use of drugs to induced altered states of both conscious and 
sensitory awareness in individuals, particularly within a medical context to enable other procedures that would be painful, 
dangerous, or outright impossible to perform. 
In ideal conditions, dedicated anaesthesiologists participate in any procedure requiring use of these sorts of substances, however 
the expeditionary and frontier enviroments a ship's crew find themselves in can rarely allow for anything considered ideal by 
civilized standards. While some individuals may work primarily within this field as their specialty, it is not uncommon for more 
adventuring medical experts to also study in it extensively alongside other topics in order to create a more monolithic practice. 
Seasoned ship's surgeons will tell you that performing amputations is notably eaiser whenever you're able to provide more to a 
patient than alcohol and common narcotics.
 
You gain the following benefits after acquiring this ability:
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any Ability Roll related to knowledge of anesthetic substances and practices. 
	This modifier cannot stack with any other modifier provided by Medicine or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities, except 
	for the bonus provided by the Microfabricator Physician Secondary Ability.
- You gain access to the Sedate and Tranquilize Techniques.


Sedate (M-fab)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab to immediately reduce Stress for yourself or another individual, or prepare them for
a medical procedure.
You may expend 1 AP and 5 Material to make a Medicine (Acuity + Memory) roll targeting yourself or another individual within arm's
reach. The target threshold for this roll is 3, and the target's Stress is reduced by a value equal to the sum of all successful dice.
Stress cannot be reduced below 0, and the roll for this action cannot benefit from any Roll or Effect Modifiers.
If you are not in combat, you can choose to apply the Unconcious Status to the target of this Technique.
If you can make use of a medical workstation, med-bay, or hospital facilities, then you can use this Technique without an m-fab, 
and doing so removes the Material cost of the Technique as well.

If an individual is affected by any combination of Stress-reducing drugs and/or the Sedate Technique more than once a day, they 
receive an amount Damage equal to 6 minus their Heartiness each time they do so after the first.


Tranquilize (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a non-lethal projectile containing a fast-acting drug that can
temporarily disable a target.
You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against one target you can see within 50m using 
Engineering (Finesse + Acuity). The projectile is a fragile apparatus made of up small syringe with a kinetic plunger, and will
easily break when hitting hard surfaces.

If this attack is successful, it deals no Damage, instead the target is immediately put into a special version of the Unconscious
Status (Section 5. Statuses contains the base rules for the Unconscious Status). 
This version of the Unconscious Status follows all the base rules for the status, in addition to the following rules:
- The status ends automatically after the target ends a number of their turns equal to the number of dice that succeeded on the 
	roll for the attack that triggered the status.
- The status ends immediately after the target takes any amount of Damage, or is hit by any form of attack, regardless of if that
	attack dealt Damage or not. 
- Any individual within arm's reach of a target affected by this status can choose to expend 1 AP to deal 1 Damage to the target,
	immediately ending the status.  

The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended for
rest of the turn.


\\\


Toxicology
--
Req: Journeyman Medicine
Cost:

This ability represents specialized experience and knowledge concerning medically toxic substances, their effect on the body and mind,
as well as the treatment of affected individuals.
You gain the following benefits after acquiring this ability:
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any Ability Roll related to knowledge of toxic substances. This modifier cannot 
	stack with any other modifier provided by Medicine or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities, except for the bonus provided
	by the Microfabricator Physician Secondary Ability.
- If you know the Microfabricator Physician Secondary Ability, you gain access to the Toxify and Antidote Techniques.


Toxify (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab to deliver a potent concoction of various toxins, including some psychoactive agents.
The substance causes immediate mental and bodily harm while also inducing a ongoing effect that can potentially debiliate the target
indefinitely unless treated.

You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a melee attack action against one target you can see within range using 
Medicine (Finesse + Acuity). This attack involves directly injecting the target with the agent.
Alternatively, if you possess at least a Novice Ability Level in Engineering, you may instead make the attack as a ranged attack 
action against one target you can see within 50m using Medicine (Finesse + Acuity). When performed this way the attack is instead 
fired as a small projectile that delivers the toxins, however the projectile is fragile and cannot penetrate hard surfaces.

If successful, the target must also perform the Toxify Save, rolling 2d6 and comparing the results against their Heartiness Attribute.
A die "fails" if the result is higher than the target's Heartiness.
	If the target fails on both dice, they receive the Toxified Status permanantly until they are treated, or until they die.
	If the target fails on only one die, they receive the Toxified Status for a number of turns equal to your Acuity Attribute, 
		until they are treated, or until they die.
	If the target succeeds on all dice, they resist the Toxified Status entirely.
	(Note: Section 5. Statuses constains a description of the Toxified Status, including the methods of removing it.)	

If the target becomes Toxified, they roll 1 die of equal size to the die provided by your Medicine Ability Level, and take Damage 
equal to the amount rolled. 

All Damage inflicted by this Technique, including the initial attack action as well as the subesquent Toxified Status, causes Stress
equal to the value of Damage inflicted, instead of merely half that amount. Additionally, Lancers do not ignore Stress inflicted by
this Damage source.
Damage inflicted by this Technique and the Toxified Status also ignore Armor Mitigation.
The Toxified Status prevents a target from healing via the Combat Regeneration Technique, however the status is removed by 
Regen-Stims and does not block that healing.

If the attack is delivered as a projectile, the m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown 
period to become cool enough to produce a stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action 
that requires Material to be expended for rest of the turn.


Antidote (M-fab)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab to generate and administer a generalized concoction designed to quickly and safely block
the mechanisms by which most toxins and poisons attack the body.  

You may expend 1 AP and 5 Material to use this Technique on a target within arm's reach.

This Technique automatically ends the Toxified Status on a target, and should cure most common poisons and toxins a character might
encounter. It also ends the effects of the Tranquilize Technique automatically.
However, if the GM determines that a source is strong enough or rare enough that it could potentially not be affected by this 
Technique, you should make a Treatment Save with a number of d6 dice determined by your GM, who can then decide the outcome of the 
action based on the number of successful saves they desire. The GM may also choose to simply forgo the Treatment Save and determine
that this Technique cannot cure a particular source. 

After being the target of this Technique an individual should make a 3d6 Heartiness Save. They are unable to benefit from the Sedate
Technique for a number of rounds equal to the amount of dice they failed on during the save.

This Technique allows you to craft and utilize Adaptive Micro-Mines, or AMMs.
AMMs are small, modular, "smart", anti-personnel mines design to provide greater flexibility to combat M-fab Techniques.

You can spend 1 hour working to create a batch of AMMs. When you do so, you make a Subtley (Acuity) or Engineering (Acuity) roll.
The threshold for this roll is 3, and you create a number of AMMs (minimum 1) equal to the number of successes on that roll.
You must use XX credit value of raw materials for each AMM you create. 
As long as you have this Technique you are not limited to using only your own AMMs, but can use those crafted by others as well.

A character with access to this Technique can choose to use an AMM to deploy an M-fab Technique with the Attack Tag instead of 
making a direct attack, if they currently are carrying expendable AMMs. 
To do so, roll the Attack Action as normal, and note the value of each dice rolled, including any Modifiers. 
This Attack Action is "stored" in the AMM, which is planted within 1m of the user as part of the action. 

The AMM lasts for a number of hours equal to the user's Acuity, and can be deactivated remotely by the user at any time.

After being deployed, the AMM has a 5m range and will attack the first creature that enters into its range that is not a known ally
of the user.

When activated, the AMM launches the stored attack against the triggering creature, comparing the stored values against the 
creature's Defense as normal. Successful dice apply Damage normally and activate any effects that would the stored Technique would
typically active.
