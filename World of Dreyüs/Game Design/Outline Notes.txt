Dice System: Stat + Skill (I think we go with Attribute + Abilities)
	Stat = number of available dice (Potential? Maybe 1 dice per 2x stat?)
	Skill (Ability?) = size of dice (d6-d12 most likely)
		Decision to make: how to vehicles scale? Consider: Potential amplifier? (aka, more dice per roll)
	Consider: maybe some skills/abilities use multiple or split other stats, for instance atk is power + dex?)
			aka Potential for atk could be 1/2 pow + 1/2 dex, other rolls might be 1/1 pow?

	Roll vs Effect modifiers (per dice before check vs added to total after check)



\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\



Turn Economy: Action Point
	Consider: Base 2 points
		Attack = 2 points, move = distance per point, defend = 1 point, item interaction = 1 point <- basically this
			Note: item interaction is the exchange of what is in ones hand with something else
				empty hand is null object, i.e. emptying hand = same cost as exchanging items. 

	- openings/mistakes/critical-fails
		>Target, or nearest hostile(s) can use X AP as a reaction before roll resolves, where X is number of rolled 1's.




\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\



Attributes: 
	
	1-5 for each
	1 = below average
	2 = average
	3 = above average
	4 = exceptional
	5 = nearly super-human

		Power: physical strength, carry weight, ability to wield large weapons
		Finesse: deftness, hand-eye, precision, body control (helps derive armor?)
		Heartiness: derives health points (and armor with dex?)
		Speed: derives AP & movement value (data note: avg human = 1.5 m/s)
		Charm: physical & emotional appeal
		Acuity: perception or ability to understand/comprehend as well as rely on well-developed tendecies ('muscle memory')
		Memory: potential depth of recollection
		Tenacity: mental resilience, ability to stay calm, resist stress
		
		Listed order: H T S F A P C M
			Emphasizes attributes that leads to derived stats

	Derived Stats:
		
		->Health: derived from Heartiness ( x 10), use threshold = wounded, double = dying, dying = next hit dead
								one hit deal 4x health = instakill (direct hits from ships could) 
		
		->Defense: Heartiness + Finesse (caps at 10, i like this)
		
		->Movement value: speed as meters per second, can be augmented by abilities
												
		
		->AP: derived from speed (bonus from class? i think if combined w/ 1/2 spd round up?) 
		
		->Control: mental hp, 10x tenacity? 
			Take Stress damage
				- when being attacked
				- if wounded 
				- if nearly died
				- experts take passively each turn of foot-combat
				- stress inflicting abilities
			hit threshold = distracted, penalty to Potential. 
			Double = Panic, chance to be unable to act
			triple = unconcious, can be awoken but will fall back unconcious if stressed more
		
		->Carry Weight: kilos = 10 x power, movement penalties?
		
	
	Scaling - Logarithmic acquisition cost, especially past 3. 4-5 should be a significant feat, and the individual remarkable, 
			enough so that to have many above 3 and multiple at 5 is a awe-inspiring legend. Consider creating mechanical
			hard-limits, allowing only a few 5s, or creating an absolute limit to total combined Attributes that 
			represents human limitations and inability to excel at all things. Be cautious of over encouraging min-maxing	
			but also attempt to prevent godlike perfection.



\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\



Abilities:

	Two types: Primary and Secondary
	
	Abilities reflect an indvidual's knowledge and/or skill in a field. 
	Mechanically, Abilities have two primary functions:
		- determines size of dice used for an action 
		- grants individuals access to particular techniques or actions that can be performed, sometimes multiple times per
			ability, distributed across the levels.
	
	Dice Scaling - Primary Abilities have 4 levels, from lowest to highest: novice, journeyman, master, legend
			Any action taken can be assigned a related Ability, however if an individual has no related Ability they are
			said to be unskilled at that action.
		This leads to the following heirarchy to determine what dice to roll based on one's Ability or lack thereof
			Unskilled 	- d4
			Novice	  	- d6
			Journeyman 	- d8
			Master		- d10
			Legend		- d12

	Techniques - Many abilities will grant techniques that result in unique in-game actions or modifications to other actions, 
		especially in the case of Secondary Abilities. These can be granted at one or more levels, and range from combat or
		martial art techniques with weapons or m-fabs to out of combat feats that reflect one's knowledge and skill.
	
	Secondary Abilties are 1 level only and serve to add special bonuses and/or techniques to a primary ability. They rely on
		the level of the primary ability to determine dice size. These mostly will exist as class-restricted customization
		options that give classes unique choices and identity via mutual exclusivity.
  
	Primary Abilities should have a level-to-level acquisition cost that is more logarithmic than linear, and becoming a legend 
		should take a significant time investment. Balance against Attribute acquisition cost, consider scaling of one vs 
		the other such that splitting investments is preferred. We want to avoid Superhuman Novices. 
	
	Secondary abilities should probably scale depending on power, likewise locked behind level in ability depending on
		relative strength.



\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\



Technology (aka Magic System) (M-fab Abilties)

	All 'techs' (casters) use same tool, microfabricator (m-fabs, or micro-fabs more commonly).
		Using m-fab abilities requires AP and consumes material resource (need a name here, mats as placeholder)
			can be modified for customization, for instance adding diagnostic modules for either medical or mechanical
			mats replaced via 'recharge canisters' (chargers?), generic resupply good that can be bought easily
				most crews would carry a large stock of these, as they are key to repairs and general tool use.

	Scope and distribution of abilities/spells, need several or few? 
		initial thought: relegate to ability-like distribution, ability for burning stuff, ability for freezing/slowing, 
				ability for medicine, ability for repair, ability for shock/stun, etc.
			I like this, i think make ability for each, then scale it via mastery/levels, unlock more effects 



\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\



Items/Gear:		

	
	Quality: 	
		Novice 		+0 
		Journeyman 	+1
		Master		+2
		Legend		+3

	Weapons: bonus damage on success (effect modifier)
		Small guns 	- d4
		Small melee	- d6
		Large guns 	- d8
		Large melee	- d12
		
		Quality modifier won't effect damage, but if a weapon has a unique function or is used in a non-combat way,
			such as being displayed to demonstrate its in-world quality, then the modifier might be used. 
			->Consider if a check is made to break a weapon, use quality to add a modifier to that check threshold.

	M-fabs:
		quality as roll modifier
		rely on 'material' supply to use abilities
			'material' pool: Novice  - 30
					 Journey - 40
					 Master  - 50
					 Legend	 - 60
		all resuplied from same 'resupply pods', always expends pod to reach max capacity. 
			higher quality m-fabs therefor get mor material per pod, respresenting efficiency

	Armor: reduces damage taken when hit successfully 
		more effective vs melee than vs lasers. 
		dmg reduction = quality mod (+2 if vs melee attacker)
				Rng | Mel
			Novice:	 0  |  2
		       Journey:  1  |  3
			Master:  2  |  4
			Legend:  3  |  5

	Consumable:
		I think we make these the unique results of certain predetermined uses of abilties
			need production gear, takes time to make, cost resources. cheap AP cost but mild effect
			supplements active BattleTechs, but not a viable replacement		

	Tools: Tools for abilities not covered by m-fabs such as music, or macro-fabrication such as weapon crafting, shipwright, 
		or surgical apparatus. Production tools to make consumables.
		Quality as roll modifier
	



\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\



Class System:
	
	Class list:
		Lancer	   <- fighters who can hold their own with saber and pistol, as well as pilot the dangerous sky-lances
		Marksman   <- Snipers proficient with trib-guns, both handheld and ship-mounted.
		Battletech <- combat engineers adapt at using m-fabs to damage and disrupt enemies, or heal and repair friendlies
		Experts	   <- specialists who excel at learning non-combat abilities, excellent pilots, surgeons, ecologists, etc.
	
	Notes:
	- Lancer: starts melee journeyman, navigation, and 1 freebie novice
		melee multiatteck, acess to unique advanced combat skill upgrades: swashbuckler (swing+shoot), brawler (swing+swing)
		does not take stress from being attacked but can from wounded, etc.
	- Marksman: starts shooting skill journeyman, analysis, 1 freebie novice
		shoot multiattack, access to shooting skill upgrades: sniping (range + crit), gunslinger (shoot+shoot)
	- BattleTech: novice marksman or novice melee, Engineering or Medicine at journeyman, and 2 secondary abilities, at least one
		of which must have the "M-fab" tag on the ability or one of techniques provided by ability.
		tech multiattack, access to unique m-fab upgrades and integrations 				
	- Experts: starts choice of 5 abilities, any combination of primaries at Journeyman or secondaries that qualify.
		choices cant have attack, evade, or defend tags on ability or techniques provided by ability.
		learns non-combat abilities faster via acuity, bonus to ability rolls outside of foot-combat
		takes stress passively per turn of foot combat
		 

	Note: All PC's end up with at least 2 Acuity as a baseline. 
		This can be explained by the fact that participating in a sky-sailing crew is a difficult job, that not all can do. 
		It requires a decent Acuity, which represets one's ability to perceive and understand.
		Thus this Attribute is fundamental to any sky-sailor, and is reflected in that most rolls for vehicles require it.
		NPCs that aren't sky-sailors, or are part of the Auxillary Crew, may have a 1 in Acuity.
			 


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\




Starting Conditions/Progression: 
	
	Class starts (see class system for static skill starts):

	Progression
		learning new abilities, increasing the level of abilities, or raising attributes requires experience points
		should scale, requiring more points for higher levels or attributes
		doing things, especially challenging or noteworthy, should grant experience points in a way that reflect what was
			accomplished
		incororate training system
			training can yield experience points towards specific goals
			partner & mentor system
			Experts should give extra partner/mentor bonus to others

Vehicle Mechanics:

	

	Create general size classes based on mast number and overall size:
		Small  	1 (Mainmast)
		Medium	2 or 3 (Mainmast and combination of Foremast and/or Mizzenmasts)
		Large   3 (Mainmast, Foremast, and Mizzenmast)
		Huge    4 (Mainmast, Foremast, Mizzenmast, and Jiggermast)

	Some Rules:

			Strong - Full Speed
			Normal - -5 m/s
			Weak   - -10 m/s
			Calmed - 1 m/s
				Note: for aerial movement, encourages altitude shifts to find different winds.
					Use 'levels' of altitude rather than exact distances?
		Navigation and Helming Roll:
			 3 + Navigational Difficulty(ND) for each direction (Reaching, Downwind, Windward) 
	
	Ship Components:
		Crew Spaces: 
			Bunk Cabin 	- +5 Berth  | Space: 1 Compartment
			Officer Cabin	- +2 Berth  | Space: 1 Compartment
			Captain Cabin   - +1 Berth  | Space: 1 Compartment
			Bunk Deck 	- +10 Berth | Space: 2 Compartments
		Gundecks:
			Full Gundeck - 1/2 compartments on that Deck	(Can be Automated - Remove Aux Crew Req)
				Aux Crew: Small (0), Medium (10), Large (XX), Huge (XX)
			Half Gundeck - 1/2 of full gundeck on that Deck (Can be Automated - Remove Aux Crew Req)
				Aux Crew: Small (0), Medium (5), Large (XX), Huge (XX)
		Rigging:
			Aux Crew Req based on Sail Plan, can be autmomated to remove Req. 
		
		Shipe Width - Narrow, Average, Wide
			Compartments Per Deck Change:
				Small: -2, 0, +2 
				Medium:
				Large:
				Huge:
			Navigational Difficulty Change:
				Small: -1, 0, +1

	Ship Attributes
		Size Class:		Determines ship available sail plans as well as helping derive compartments per deck.
						Also gives reference for magnitude of systems on ship (power source, etc).
						Derives maximum Gun Class, thanks to relation to power supply.
		Sail Plan:		Rigging layout, options differ per Size Class. Derives many other Ship Attributes.
		Hull Style:		Affects cost, durability, and ability to have gundecks below the topdeck. (Clinker vs Carvel)
		Sky-Speed: 		Derived from Sail Plan. The craft's max speed in the air while reaching. 
						Downwind = 75%, Windward 50%	
		Surface-Speed: 		Derived from Sail Plan. Max speed in water, reduces similiarly to Skyspeed.
		Durability:		Derives from Sail Plan and Hull Style. Ship HP is 50 x Durability, ships take 2x HP before 
						being 'killed'.
		Width: 			Narrow, Average, or Wide. Trades Navigation Difficulty for Compartments per Deck.
						Availability varies by Sail Plan.
		Navigation Difficulty:	Derived from Sail Plan and Width. Values for Reaching, Downwind, and Windward.
						Varies by Sail Plan + Width.
		Deck Number:		Derived from Sail Plan. Amount of decks (levels) to a craft. 
						Multiplies the number of compartments based on Size Class and Width.
		Compartments per Deck:	Derived from Size class and Width. Determines amount of space on craft.
		Berth:			Maximum number of people the craft can accomodate. 
						Increases by setting aside compartments as living space.
		Cargo Space:		Number of compartments set aside for cargo plus hold space.
		Broadside Power:	Added Potential for Gunnery rolls from the side.
						Derived from the number of full and half gundecks: +2 per full, +1 per half.
						Note: can be 0 if craft has no gundecks at all, and therefore is unable to attack.
		Chaser Power:		Added Potential for Gunnery rolls from the front or back.
						Derived from number of full gundecks: +1 per full.
						Note: can be 0 if craft has no full gundecks, and therefore is unable to attack  
							forward or aft.
		Gun Class:		Dice added as bonus damage to successful attacks with the craft's guns.
						Light	 - 2d10 Broad, 1d10 Chaser
						Moderate - 2d12 Broad, 1d12 Chaser
						Heavy 	 - 2d20 Broad, 1d20 Chaser
						Limited by Size Class.
							Small  - up to Light
							Medium - up to Moderate
							Large  - up to Heavy
						 	Huge   - up to Heavy
								Note: Huge craft get to roll 1 extra GC dice when hitting,
									no matter their GC. (3 dice for broadside, 2 dice chaser)
		Auxillary Crew Size:	Minimum number of spare crew members needed to operate craft. 
						Varies by sail plan and system automation. Can be 0 if craft has full automization.
		
	Primary Crew Roles (Rolls for operating a skycraft):
		Navigator (Acuity + Memory) - Determines a craft's course.
						On Small craft can serve as Engineer's roll in combination when changing altitude. 
						On Small and Medium 2-mast craft can serve as Helmsman's roll in combination.
							Becomes Acuity + Charm if needing to interact with a rigging crew.
		Engineer  (Acuity + Memory) - Manages the craft's technical systems, rolls for any mid-action repairs.
						Required to roll seperate for altitude changes on Medium and larger craft. 
		Helmsman  (Acuity)          - Steers a ship and guides the rigging crew, if any. 
						Required as seperate roll on craft with at least 3 masts.
						Becomes Acuity + Charm when without automated rigging.
		Gunnery   (Acuity)          - Commands the craft's armament. Rolls to attack with the guns using ranged weapon skill.
						Gets added Potential on ranged weapon roll based on craft's armament.
						Can order attacks from Broad and Chaser in same turn, but does so as seperate rolls. 
						Becomes Acuity + Charm when without automated gundecks.		


	Lances, and to a lesser extent all Sail-boards or other vehicles, follow slightly different but similiar rules.
		
		Vehicles may require seperate individuals to roll for each behaviour (moving, attacking, etc)
			or allow multiple to be done by one individual.
		
		One-person craft should allow the pilot to do all normal rolls in one turn.

		Sail-boards and Lances
			Attributes:
				Sky-Speed & Surface-Speed - identical definition to normal craft. Faster than sky-sailing craft.
				Lift-Drive Class - Surface or Sky, depending on if is sky-capable or not.
				Capacity - carriable weight
				Navigation Difficulty - Same rules as normal craft
					Roll is Acuity + Power, rather than Memory or Charm
				Can attack with mounted Lance, or personal tribgun
					Tribgun roll as if on foot, subject to half dmg vs vehicle
					Lance roll - Acuity + Finesse, but uses Melee Attacking skill
						Also gets Heavy Chaser Gun Class bonus (1d20 bonus dmg on hit)
