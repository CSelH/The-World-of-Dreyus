Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abilities represent the knowledge and skill a character possesses, and are used in game whenever a character makes an Action Roll.
As previously described, whenever a character attempts an action where the outcome was uncertain they may make a dice roll where the
size of dice is determined by the character's Ability Level, and the number of available dice is determined by their Potential.
Along with this function, Abilties can also give character's new capabilities, including Techniques that provide new actions they may 
use, or improvements to actions they already know.

All Player characters start with some known Abilties that reflect their class's fundamental skillset. 
Characters can learn new Abilities or improve known Abilities by accumulating Experience Points through both training and successful
feats during real action.

Following is an explanation of Primary and Secondary Abilities, including Ability Level and Techniques. This explanation
is prefaced by a section on Ability Tags, which provide common set of general rules that pertain to many seperate abilities.

Ability Tags
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Ability's description might include an Ability Tag, which marks it as part of a set of Abilities that share some common rules.
Ability Tags apply their rules in the same way to all Abilites that have that tag, although occasionally Abilities can provide 
features that create explicit exceptions.

As a reference, some of the most common Ability Tags relate to Abilities that can be used in combat, including the Attack, Defend,
and Ranged Tags. These tags describe the basic rules for how those Abilities are used in combat. 
Other common tags include the M-Fab Tag, which marks Abilties that make use of Micro-Fabricators, and the Crafting Tag, denoting 
Abilities that can produce items or consumables.

A reference list of Ability Tags and their descriptions can be found in section 6a, prefacing the list of abilities.

Primary Abilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Abilities are the main representation of a character's knowledge and skill pertaining to a particular field. They typically
represent fairly generalized fields or concepts, such as Marksmanship, Engineering, Piloting, Biology, or Anthropology. All Player
Characters start with some Primary Abilities already known, representing their character's background qualifications to perform the
jobs typically given to their class.

Characters can only perform Action Rolls for which they possess a related Primary Ability. Characters can make desperate "Struggle 
Rolls" whenever they do not possess a related Primary Ability, however these rolls have a very high failure rate and often only allow
for diminished results, thus they should not be relied upon.

Typically, the Player in control of a Character will describe to the GM how a Primary Ability relates to the Action Roll they wish to
attempt. For instance, a Player may suggest that a Character attempts to analyze a corpse with their Biology ability, or shoot at
a target with a slingshot using their Marksmanship ability. All Primary Abilities can be used in this way, allowing the Player to 
creatively interpret their abilities to find uses for them in various situations. 

Section 6a contains a list of Primary Abilities included in the system, however the list is not meant to be exclusive, and Players are
encouraged to suggest new Primary Abilities that represent areas of skill and knowledge that have been overlooked. In other words:
Basketweaving isn't provided in the seciton 6a list, but you can absolutely request for your GM to allow your character to learn it.

 

Ability Levels
--
All Primary Abilities are stratified into Ability Levels, which denote the character's expertise in that Ability, and increases the
size of the dice the character can use for Action Rolls with that Ability. Access to Techniques and Secondary Abilities related to 
the Primary Ability is often only given once a character reaches a certain Ability Level in that Primary Ability.
 
These are the 4 Ability Levels and the size of dice they grant:
	Novice 		- 6-sided (d6)
	Journeyman	- 8-sided (d8)
	Master		- 10-sided (d10)
	Legend		- 12-sided (d12)

Characters start as a Novice, representing a basic understanding and capability. The highest level possbile is Legend, which denotes
an exceptional individual with the capability of absolute perfection in their field. 

Characters can learn new abilities as well as increase their Ability Level for a known Primary Ability by expending Experience Points,
although the cost increases significantly at each level. 



Techniques
--
Some Abilities may include Techniques in their description. Techniques are advanced applications of an ability, taking the form of
specific Action Rolls a player can perform with that ability, granting unique and powerful effects. 

It is important to note that Primary Abilities that provide Techniques can still be used for other Action Rolls described by the 
Player in the normal way. In other words: Techniques are not the only Action Rolls that the Primary Ability can be used for. 
Techniques are additional bonus functions for an ability, are not the lone use case.



\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


Secondary Abilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secondary Abilities represent specializations, offshoots, and intersections of knowledge governed by Primary Abilities. 
These abilities modify or add to one or more related Primary Abilties. They typically allow for the Primary Ability to be used in new 
ways, and often grant new, powerful Techniques. 

Secondary Abilities do not have an Ability Level, and do not contribute to dice scaling. 

Secondary Abilities have prequisites that must be met before a character can learn them. Normally this takes the form of requiring 
the character to have a minimum Ability Level in one or more specific Primary Abilities. Some Secondary Abilities are also restricted 
to specific Classes. Once a character meets the requirements for a Secondary Ability, they may acquire that ability by expending 
Experience Points, similiar to acquiring or upgrading a Primary Ability.

A list of Secondary Abilities is provided in section 6a.
