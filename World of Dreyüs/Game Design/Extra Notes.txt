Econmy Note:

Need to derive economy backwards from ships.

Repair costs equal to some % of ship cost based on damage to the ship (maybe direct 1-1?).

This should derive to raw material avg values per metric tonne (standard unit of storage).
That should led to method of cost determination for smaller objects and other vehicles.
