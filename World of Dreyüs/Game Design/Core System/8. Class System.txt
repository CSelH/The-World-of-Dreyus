Abilities a character starts with, and somewhat affect a character's progression, such as access to class-restricted Abilities.

by these names in a way similiar to a job title. These classes essentially represent a training background possessed by the character
before the tale begins. While certain commonalities will exist between individuals that share a particular class, individuals are 
free to pursue a wide variety advancements as they see fit. A Lancer might have incredible medical knowledge, a Marksman could be a 
proficient Hand-to-Hand fighter, a Battletech might be a renowed fencing master, and an Expert might even happen to be crack shot.
