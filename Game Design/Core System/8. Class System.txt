Abilities a character starts with, and somewhat affect a character's progression, such as access to class-restricted Abilities.

The four classes represent archetypes of the kinds of individuals who serve on sky-ship crews, and are sometimes referred to in world
by these names in a way similiar to a job title. These classes essentially represent a training background possessed by the character
before the tale begins. While certain commonalities will exist between individuals that share a particular class, individuals are 
free to pursue a wide variety advancements as they see fit. A Lancer might have incredible medical knowledge, a Marksman could be a 
proficient Hand-to-Hand fighter, a Battletech might be a renowed fencing master, and an Expert might even happen to be a crack shot.

The later section on character creation contains the exact rules describing the starting benefits of each class.
