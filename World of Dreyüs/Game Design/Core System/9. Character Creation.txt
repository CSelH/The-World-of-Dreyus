Character creation is relatively simple in World of Drey√ºs, mechanically only requiring the player to choose their starting class,
abilities, and equipment. The character's class and abilities should reflect their background, such as their educational focus or
military training. 

This section describes the process of creating a character: selecting their class, determining their Attributes and Derived Stats,
outlining their starting Abilities, and selecting their starting equipment.

Players should discuss their character's background with the GM. Consider where and how the character received the training they have,
how they have entered into the circumstances of the game's story, and what their goals starting out should be.





The first mechanical decision that must be made is the character's Class.
The classes, Lancer, Marksman, Battletech, and Expert, are qualitatively described in the section directly preceding this one.
Your Class will strongly influence your character's starting capabilities, and should reflect the character's history.
Select a Class, and note it as your Class on your character sheet.


The second step is to determine the character's starting Attributes and Derived Stats. 
All characters start with a 1 for each Attribute, and the character's class increases some their Attributes as follows:
	
	- Lancer: +1 Heartiness, +1 Tenacity, +1 Speed, +1 Finesse, +1 Acuity, +1 Power
	- Marksman: +1 Tenacity, +2 Finesse, +1 Acuity
	- Battletech: +1 Tenacity, +2 Acuity, +1 Memory
	- Expert: +2 Acuity, +1 Charm, +2 Memory 

Note the character's Attribute values on their character sheet and then calculate and note their Derived Stats by the following:
	- Health: 10 X Heartiness 
	- Control: 10 X Tenacity
	- Defense: Heartiness + Finesse
	- Passive Perception: Tenacity + Acuity
	- Movement Value: A number of meters equal to Speed
	- Action Points: 1 + Speed
	- Carry Weight: 10 x Power




The next step should be to determine and note down the character's starting Abilities, which are determined by the character's Class.

	Lancers begin with the following:
		- Journeyman Melee Weapons
		- Novice Navigation
		- Player's choice of 1 Novice Primary Ability.
		- Fearless Technique

		Fearless
		-----
		This Technique makes Lancers immune to the 1d4 Stress increase caused by being targeted by attacks.
		Additionally, Lancers may reroll one of the dice rolled whenever making a Panic Save.




	Marksmen begin with the following:
		- Journeyman Marksmanship
		- Novice Analysis
		- Player's choice of 1 Novice Primary Ability.




	Battletechs begin with the following:
		- Novice Marksmanship OR Novice Melee Weapons
		- Journeyman Engineering OR Journeyman Medicine
		- Player's choice of 1 Secondary Ability the character meets the requirements of that has the M-fab Tag on the 
			Ability itself or at least one Technique provided by the Ability. 
		- Player's choice of 1 additional Secondary Ability the character meets the requirements of.




	Experts begin with the following:
		- Player's choice of any combination of 5 Abilities.
			Primary Abilities are acquired at Journeyman Level, and the character must meet the requirements for any 
			Secondary Abilities that would be chosen. 
			No more than one of the selected Abilities may have the Attack Tag on the ability itself or its Techniques.
		- Noncombatant and Quick Study Techniques
		
		Noncombatant
		-----
		This Technique forces Experts to roll 1d6 at the end of each of their turns when in non-vehicle combat, increasing
		their Stress by 1 if the result is higher than their Tenacity.
		Additionally, they gain a +1 Roll Modifier to one dice rolled for any Ability Roll made oustide of combat.
		
		Quick Study
		-----
		This Technique allows Experts to learn new Abilities faster based on their Acuity.
		As long as the Ability does not contain the Attack Tag on itself or any Technique it provides, Experts can reduce 
		the number of Experience Points required for them to acquire the Ability by an amount equal to their Acuity.
		The Experience Point cost of learning an Ability cannot be reduced below 1.




The last mechanical decision is to select and note the character's starting equipment, also determined by the character's Class:

	Lancers - Choice: Two Small Melee Weapons or One Large Melee Weapon
		  Choice: One Small Tribgun, One Small Melee weapon, or an M-fab
		  Choice: Novice Armor, One Small Melee Weapon, or One Small Tribgun


	Marksmen - Choose Twice: Two Small Tribguns or One Large Tribgun
		   Choice: One Small Melee Weapon, One Small Tribgun, or an M-fab


	BattleTechs - Choice: Two Small Tribguns, Two Small Melee Weapons, One Large Tribgun, or One Large Melee Weapon
		      An M-fab


	Expert - Choice: One Small Melee Weapon, One Small Tribgun, or an M-fab
		 A set of tools or equipment required for one of your starting Primary Abilities, such as a doctor's kit or a set of
			cartography measures and drawing utensils.
		 (Note: Experts can opt to forgo the first choice in favor of a second set of tools appropriate to one of their
			Abilities.)




Finally, after noting the details as described above and discussing with your GM about the starting circumstances of the game, make
some notes as to what you believe the character's initial goals and/or values should be. You might also include a description of the
character's backstory if you desire. These details can assist in focusing on the character's identity and understanding how they may
act in the situations you are about to find them in.

Congratulations! You are now ready to play!

The final section of the rules will describe how character's progress, including how to increase their Attributes and acquire new 
Abilities.
