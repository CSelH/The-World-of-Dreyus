
While all kinds of objects, materials, and devices exist in the world, there are a handful that are mechanically significant which a 
Player can interact with in the game. This section covers the general rules for those items, including weapons, microfabricators, 
armor, etc.

This section covers the general rules that can be applied across a whole category of items, and the subsequent section 7a contains
some specific rules and examples for certain items within the broader categories that require further explanation.

Item Quality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similiar to Ability Levels, items have 4 levels of Item Quality: Novice, Journeyman, Master, Legend. The level of Item Quality 
indicates the overall capability and effectiveness of an item.
Each level of Item Quality correlates to a modifier:
	Novice 		- +0
	Journeyman	- +1
	Master		- +2
	Legend		- +3

Item Quality, including the modifier, affects items slightly differently across each category. 
However, in all cases where an item is used in conjunction with a Primary Ability, the level of Item Quality bonus available to a 
character is limited by their Ability Level in the Primary Ability. In other words, a Master trib-gun in the hands of a Journeyman
in Marksmanship can only provide the same benefit as a Journeyman trib-gun. A Novice Engineer cannot get the same benefit from a
Legend M-fab that a Legend Engineer can.

Microfabricators (M-fabs)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microfabricators take many shapes and sizes, but are ubiquitous to the technologically advanced societies on the continent. Most 
skilled technicians make use of them, as they are an invaluable tool for diagnosing, repairing, and small-scale custom manufacturing.
They are a highly customizable platform, with some abilities providing characters methods to upgrade their m-fabs capabilities 
at particular tasks.

Abilities marked with the M-fab tag make use of or require a microfabricator.

M-fabs have an onboard supply of Material that is consumed whenever the m-fab is used in a generative way(e.g. repairing, healing, 
producing). If the action is one described by a Player or GM, the GM will determine the required number of Material units. 
Techniques will provide a Material cost in their description, if applicable. 

The Material pool is resupplied via consumable resupply pods. A resupply pod always fully charges an m-fab's Material pool.
M-fabs have a larger Material pool based on their Item Quality, representing the device's efficiency.
The following table describes the size of Material pool based on Item Quality:
	Novice  	- 30 units
	Journeyman	- 40 units
	Master  	- 50 units
	Legend	 	- 60 units


Whenever an m-fab is used for an Action Roll where the result is a non-combat effect, the Item Quality modifier can be applied as a 
roll modifier for each of the dice rolled.

Whenever an m-fab is used for an Ability Roll where the result is a combat effect (e.g. attacking, defending, healing, etc.) 
the Item Quality modifier can be applied as a roll modifer for only one of the dice rolled, and no others. The individual in control
of the character may choose which die, if any, this bonus is applied to.

Weapons
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreyüs, being a large continent with a variety of cultures, has no true standard armament. Depending on needs and availability, it
is possible to find sky-pirates armed with trib-guns and steel-edged sabers, tribal hunters with bone spears and recurve bows, or
nomadic merchants armed with a combination of modern and traditional weaponry. Like most other aspects of life on Dreyüs, people
make due with what they have in order to accomplish what they must. 

The efficacy of any weapon is largely determined by the capability of the wielder, and the majority of outgoing damage a character
produces is determined by their relevant attributes and abilities. Weapons serve mostly as a tool to enable a character to make use
of the corresponding abilities.

Weapons are broadly categorized into four groups: small ranged weapons, small melee weapons, large ranged weapons, and large melee 
weapons. Small weapons can be wielded in one hand, while large weapons require two hands. (Note: while using a large weapon requires
two hands, holding or carrying a large weapon may only require one hand, allowing for one open hand only whenever the weapon is not 
being actively employed for any offensive, defensive, or utility purpose.)

Characters get a bonus damage die based on their weapon's category whenever they make a successful attack with that weapon.

The following table describes the dice granted to each category:
	
	Weapon     | Die
	-----------------	
	Small ranged | 1d4
	Small melee  | 1d6
	Large ranged | 1d8
	Large melee  | 1d12
  
Note: characters attacking with a small weapon in each hand can benefit from the bonus damage from each weapon if their attacking 
Action Roll succeeds on at least two dice. If an attacker succeeds with only one dice on their roll, they may only benefit from one 
weapon's bonus damage die. 

Weapons are also defined by their Item Quality. The Item Quality modifier is applied in particular ways for weapons.

If a character uses a weapon as part of a Action Roll that is not a direct combat action they may apply the Item Quality modifier
to each dice rolled as a roll modifier. These could be rolls made to convince someone of the quality of the weapon, attacking rolls
made for non-combat reasons (e.g. cutting a rope, shooting a lock), or when using the weapon to intimidate. Ultimately, whether or
not a potential action should be considered "non-combat" should be determined by the GM.

Whenever a character uses a weapon for an Action Roll where the result is a combat effect, the Item Quality modifier can be applied 
as a roll modifer for only one of the dice rolled, and no others. The individual in control of the character may choose which dice, 
if any, this bonus is applied to.

Note: Characters using a small weapon in each hand for combat Action Rolls may apply the Item Quality roll modifier from each 
weapon, but they cannot use both modifiers on the same die. The individual in control of the character may choose which dice, if any, 
the roll modifiers are applied to. 

Some ranged weapons, particularly trib-guns, are considered Energy-based weapons for the purpose of Armor Mitigation. This makes them
more effective at dealing damage to armored targets. The Armor section provides a detailed explanation of this rule.

Armor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personal protective gear in Dreyüs takes the form of mundane, if finely engineered, material-based equipment similiar to our own 
world. Different cultural styles exist, and material supply limits often affect standard quality, cost, and availabilty for any given
society. As such, armor found in Dreyüs can be as simple as layered fabrics from plant-based fibers, boiled leather molded to shape,
or hard plates sewn into fabric for added protection. Cultures with more advanced engineering and material capabilites may make use 
of synthetic materials, have easier access to high-quality alloys, or employ advanced manufacturing or design methods that allow for
greater supply of consitently higher-quality armor. 

Characters may acquire a set of armor via crafting, bartering, or as part of their character's starting equipment. For game purposes,
armor is defined by its Item Quality level, which determines how effective the armor's benefits are.

Armor provides an Armor Mitigation effect against succesful incoming attacks. Armor Mitigation reduces incoming damage by a set amount
determined by the kind of incoming attack, as well as the Item Quality level of the armor.

Armor Mitigation is more effective against range attacks than melee attacks, which have an easier time of finding the weakpoints
in the armor. 

Against melee attacks, Armor Mitigation is equal to the Item Quality level modifier. Against ranged attacks, Armor Mitigation is equal
to the Item Quality level modifer, plus two. The following table describes these values:
	
	        Vs. Melee | Vs. Ranged 
	Novice:     0     |     2
       Journey:     1     |     3
	Master:     2     |     4
	Legend:     3     |     5  



Energy-based Attacks and Armor Mitigation
--

Some attacks transmit their force in non-kinetic ways. Examples include thermal based attacks, such as fire or lasers, or radiation
based attacks, such as those from a neutron bomb. Any attacks that do not rely primarly on kinetic force are considered 
"Energy-based" attacks. The primary sources of Energy-based attacks for players will be trib-guns and m-fab abilities.
M-fab abilities that provide Energy-based attacks will include the Energy-based Attack Ability Tag in their description. Trib-guns
are always considered Energy-based attacks when being fired. 

Whenever taking damage from a successful Energy-based attack, Armor Mitigation can only reduce damage by an amount equal to the
armor's Item Quality modifier. This means Armor Mitigation against Energy-based attacks is the same for both ranged and melee attacks.

--

Simliar to weapons, using armor as part of an Action Roll for non-combat purposes allows a character to apply the armor's Item
Quality modifier as a roll modifier to each dice rolled.

Tools, Devices, and Workstations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Characters might make use of a variety of utility items outside of weapons, m-fabs, and armor. These can range from simple working 
tools like hammers, wrenches, and screwdrivers, or be as complex as production workstations with devices similiar to modern CNC 
machines, lathes, 3D printers, ableit more precise, advanced, and efficient, often integrating m-fab technology as well. 
Simple tools are in relatively universal supply, however complex machinery is rare among frontier and tribal cultures. 
Most ships, sky-sailing or sea-sailing, will have some form of machining or production capabities in order to make field repairs to
the ship or its equipment. 

Whenever a character makes use of some tool, device, or workstation, they may use the item's Item Quality modifier as a roll modifier
for each of the dice rolled.




\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\



Consumables
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Various consumable items can be acquired either from NPCs or by being crafted by a player's character.
Most consumable items should be accompanied by a description that gives their specific function and use. 
Sometimes these items can be of various Item Quality levels, and their description may include how the item benefits from the 
Item Quality modifier.  

Section 7a has a list of some common consumable items that can be used in your games.
