Once per round, you may choose up to two successful dice rolled for a Melee Weapons Attack to deal 0 Damage. If you do so, the target
provokes an Opening where the number of Action Points that can be spent are equal the number of dice used for this effect (maximum 2).

This Attack Action requires you to succeed on an least 3 dice, and provoke no Openings, otherwise it fails. 
If successful, this attack forces the target to forced to let go of any weapons they are holding,  which then drop to the ground at 
their feet. If your hands are free enough to hold any of the weapons that would be dropped, you may choose to take them instead of 
letting them fall to the ground.

Masterful Discipline
--
Req: Master Hand-to-Hand

Req: Battletech Class, Journeyman Engineering, Journeyman Marksmanship OR Journeyman Melee Weapons. 
Cost:
Learning this ability locks a character out of learning the Microfabricator Advanced Cooling System Secondary Ability.

You spend time fabricating and modifying your m-fab and your chosen weapon, combining to the two in order to streamline your use
of both on the battlefield. You can use a pre-existing weapon you possess, or fabricate a new one of your choice if you are able,
however the weapon must be of a type governed by the Primary Ability you used to meet the requirement for this Secondary Ability.

Your new hybrid m-fab/weapon starts with Journeyman Quality, and can be upgraded by you as you progress your Engineering Ability.

Whenever you make an attack using the m-fab component of your weapon, you may expend 1 Action Point immediately after and make a
normal (non-Technique) attack against a target you can see using the weapon Primary Ability governing your weapon.

Cost:
Learning this ability locks a character out of learning the Microfabricator-Weapon Integration Ability.

You research and design a new custom housing for your microfabricator that features a robust cooling system. With the appropriate 
materials and time you can build the device, reconfiguring an m-fab core into the new device. Despite the increase in overall bulk,
your modified microfabricator can sustain higher rates of production and emission without damaging the systems.

Your new m-fab starts with Journeyman Quality, and can be upgraded by you as you progress your Engineering Ability.

When wielding a MACS m-fab, you may use two m-fab actions with the Cooldown tag during a turn, rather than one. If you've made no 
other attack actions during a turn, one or both of m-fab actions can be attack actions.

- You gain access to the Blast and Micro-Grenade Techniques


Blast (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown, Energy-Based Attack)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a projectile composed of powerful high explosives directly 
onto a target.
You may expend 2 AP and 5 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against one target within 50m using Engineering (Finesse + Acuity).
The projectile from this attack is very fragile, and explodes on contact, requiring you to have a direct angle to the target.
The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended for
rest of the turn.


Micro-Grenade (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a small airburst grenade composed of fragible material and 
high explosives.
You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against each target within a 5m diameter sphere centered at a spot
of your choice within 50m using Engineering (Finesse + Acuity). You make only one roll for this attack, but compare the results
against each of the targets' Defense values individually to determine success.
Targets hit by this attack take Damage equal to half the value of the successful dice, rounded down. 
If the trajectory of the grenade is blocked before it reaches its target point it may deflect, bounce, roll, or drop before 
detonating before the end of the action.
The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended for
rest of the turn.

Thermals Expert
--
Req: Journeyman Engineering
Cost:

This ability represents specialized experience and knowledge in the field of thermal engineering. 
You gain the following benefits after acquiring this ability:
- You gain a +1 Roll Modifier to each dice used in any roll related to knowledge concerning topics within thermal engineering. This 
	modifier cannot stack with any other modifier provided by Engineering or one of its dependent Secondary Abilities.
- You gain access to the Ignite and Freeze Techniques.


Ignite (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown, Energy-Based Attack)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a small container of incendiary material and flammable adhesive 
fluid.
You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against one target within 50m using Engineering (Finesse + Acuity). 
The projectile from this attack is very fragile, and explodes on contact, requiring you to have a direct angle to the target.

If the attack is successful, the target is inflicted with the Inflamed Status in addition to the normal Damage inflicted.
The "Statuses" section describes the rules for the Inflamed Status.
The Damage caused by this Inflamed Status, as well as the duration of the effect, is based of your Engineering Ability Level and is
described by the following table:
	-------------------------------------
	| Ability Level | Damage | Duration |
	|---------------|--------|----------|
	|  Journeyman	|  2d4   | 3 Turns  |
	|    Master     |  3d4   | 4 Turns  |
	|    Legend     |  4d4   | 5 Turns  |
	-------------------------------------
Damage from the Inflamed Status is dealt at the start of the target's turn, and ends automatically after dealing Damage on the last 
turn of its duration. Damage from the Inflamed Status is not affected by Armor Mitigation.
The Inflamed Status can be ended early via a successful Extinguish Save, as described in the "Statuses" section.

The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended for
rest of the turn.


Freeze (M-fab, Attack, Cooldown, Energy-Based Attack)
-
This Technique allows you to use your m-fab as a firearm to deliver a small container of cryogenic material and a thermally 
superconductive adhesive. 
You may expend 2 AP and 10 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against one target within 50m using Engineering (Finesse + Acuity).
The projectile from this attack is very fragile, and explodes on contact, requiring you to have a direct angle to the target.

If the attack is successful, the target is forced to make a special Injury Save in addition to receiving the normal Damage inflicted.
If the target fails on every dice for the Injury Save (i.e. roll higher than their Heartiness Attribute on every dice), they suffer 
an Injury due to the extreme freezing effect. The number of d6 dice used for this special Injury Save is determined by your 
Engineering Ability Level and is described by the following table:
	-------------------------------
	| Ability Level | Injury Save |
	|---------------|-------------|
	|  Journeyman	|     3d6     |
	|    Master     |     2d6     |
	|    Legend     |     1d6     |
	------------------------------- 
If the target fails the Injury Save inflicted by this Technique and you do not provoke any Openings or Mistakes during the attack,
you may choose what body part receives the Injury. If an Opening or Mistake was provoked, the Injury is applied to random body part.
(Note: The GM can choose what the Injury is, or have the player roll 1d6 and use that result to determine what part is injured.)

The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended for
rest of the turn.
