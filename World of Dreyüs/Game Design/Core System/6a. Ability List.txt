-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Healing
--
This tag indicates the Ability or Technique can be used for Action Rolls to reduce the Damage on a target. 
The Action Point cost and Target Threshold for these rolls can vary depending on the situation, as well as the Ability or 
Technique providing the Healing capability. 
On success, the target's Damage is reduced by an amount equal to the value of all successful dice. 


Attack
--
This tag indicates the Ability or Technique can be used for Action Rolls to attempt to increase the Damage of a target. 
The Target Threshold for Attack Action Rolls is always at least equal to the target's Defense. Successful dice deal Damage equal to 
their value. The default cost for Attack actions is 2 Action Points.
Characters normally may only make one Attack Action per turn, however you can make multiple Attacks per round by exploiting
Openings in order to Attack during other character's turns in addition to during your own turn. 
(Note: Some effects can allow characters to bypass the "one Attack Action per turn" rule.)

Primary Abilities marked with this Tag in their title indicate the ability has some basic Attack Action that is typically always 
available as long as a character meets its basic conditions, such as wielding the correct kind of weapon.
Some abilities that do not have the Attack Tag in their title might still provide Techniques that do have the Attack Tag, allowing 
the ability to be used for some kind of Attack Action via the Technique. 


Evade
--
This tag indicates the Ability or Technique can be used for Action Rolls to attempt to avoid all kinds of incoming attacks.
Evade actions cost 1 Action Point and have a Target Threshold of 4. On success, the character's Defense increases by 2 until the end
of their next turn. If a character succeeds on an Evade action during an Opening created by an Attack action that would damage them, 
the +2 Defense bonus is applied for that Attack, potentially turning a hit into a miss.

Characters cannot take this Action while they are already under it's effects (i.e. this Action cannot be repeated to stack the effect.)


Parry
--
This tag indicates the Ability or Technique can be used for Action Rolls to attempt block to incoming melee attacks.
Parry actions cost 1 Action Point and have a Target Threshold of 4. On success, melee attacks against the user must treat the 
character's Defense as having been increased by 2 until the end of their next turn. If a character succeeds on an Parry action during
an Opening created by a melee Attack action that would damage them, the +2 Defense bonus is applied for that Attack, potentially 
turning a hit into a miss. Parry actions have no effect against ranged attacks, and the Defense bonus from Parry actions cannot
stack with the Defense bonus from Evade actions. This effect ends automatically after the Defense bonus affects an incoming
Attack Action (i.e. you can only affect one attack per Parry Action performed).

Characters cannot take this Action while they are already under it's effects (i.e. this Action cannot be repeated to stack the effect.)

Some effects trigger from a "successful Parry", this refers to anytime an opponent fails on 1 or more dice on an melee Attack 
Action against you while the Defense bonus from your Parry Action in active. The Parry effect itself does not need to be the reason
the the dice failed. This means anytime a character takes a Parry Action during an Opening created by an incoming melee Attack Action
it is always considered a "successful Parry" for the purposes of triggering secondary effects. A "successful Parry" indicates the 
character actively defended themself enough to establish some control, even if they incurred some Damage from the Attack.


Energy-based Attack
--
This tag indicates the Ability or Technique produces an Energy-based Attack. Energy-based Attacks are treated the same as melee 
attacks for the purposes of Armor Mitigation. (see "Armor" rule in "Section 7. Item System")


M-fab
--
This tag indicates the Ability or Technique makes use of a microfabricator for some or all of it's related Action Rolls.
M-fabs are handheld 3-D printers capable of manipulating most periodic elements at a molecular level in order to create a large
potential variety of effects. See the "Microfabricators" rules in "Section 7. Item System" for a more in-depth explanation.
M-fab actions often have a Material cost that reduces the m-fab's current Material pool, and cannot be perform unless the user's 
m-fab has enough Material.  


Turn-Only
--
This tag indicates the Ability or Technique has some or all of its use restricted to the character's turn, and thus cannot make use 
of it during an Opening.

Primary Abilities Reference List
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
A character's Primary Abilities represent the character's knowledge and capability in the corresponding fields. In other words, 
Primary Abilities are the main "skills" a character will posses. Any task that relies upon a character's skill or understanding 
will require an Action Roll based upon some relevant Primary Ability. 
--





\\\\\\\\\\

Marksmanship (Attack)
-----
This ability represents a character's skill with ranged weapons in general. Advancement in Marksmanship typically reflects refinement
of the related physical skills (e.g. hand-eye coordination, sighting, breathe control, etc.) as well as the character's depth of 
knowledge on the subject (e.g. range-finding, ballistics for kinetic and/or energy weapons, history).

Marksmanship is foundational to its eponymous character class, the Marksman. All Marksman begin the game with this Ability,
and have exclusive access to unique Secondary Abilities that become available after advancing their Marksmanship Ability Level.

While this Ability should be useful for essentially any kind of ranged weapon, a GM may choose to require a character to have some
amount of training or familiarity with a weapon before being allowed to apply their Marksmanship Ability to rolls involving that 
weapon. 

For instance, most player characters are assumed to be from societies that make use of tribguns (the default ranged weapon supplied
to player characters), and likely have never trained with or have never seen traditional ranged weapons such as bows or 
spear-throwing tools. Thus, the GM might not allow a character with this kind of background to immediately apply their 
Marksmanship Ability if they attempt to use such a weapon, or allow them to do so with some penalty of their choice in place. 

The standard roll for Attack Actions made with this ability is Marksmanship (Finesse + Acuity).


\\\


Ability Levels:

Novice
--
A Novice in Marksmanship has learned the fundamentals of the use and maintenance of one or more ranged weapons, and can readily 
recall basic information about the this field.


Journeyman
--
A Journeyman in Marksmanship has developed a practical, experience-based understanding of the use of ranged weapons, and can 
typically hold their own in a shootout. After advancing to this Ability Level in Marksmanship characters gain access to the
Steady Aim Prepare Shot Techniques.

Steady Aim (Turn-Only)
-
During your turn, you may spend 1 AP to activate this Technique. Until the end of your next turn, your next Attack Action using your
Marksmanship Ability gains a +1 Roll Modifier for each of the dice rolled to determine the outcome of the Attack Action.
This Technique is cancelled if your character moves or is moved.

Prepare Shot (Turn-Only)
-
During your turn, you may spend 2 AP to activate this Technique. You choose one location your character can aim towards, such as 
an entryway, chokepoint, or some other area within a roughly 90° field of view from the character's position. As long as your 
character can remain waiting in that position, you may make an Attack Action with your Marksmanship Ability against any target the 
moment it moves into the area. This attack occurs immediately and you do not spend additional AP for it. This Technique ends if your
character takes any Attack Action (including one taken through this Technique), moves, or is otherwise forced to abandon their 
readied postion. 

You do not have to attack the first target that moves into range, but can instead wait for any target so long as your character can
remain ready.  


Master
--
A Master in Marksmanship can count themselves among the best. Mostly exceptional in combat, Masters in Marksmanship can often
boast of supreme achievements in accuracy, precision, and understanding of what exactly makes the perfect shot. 
After advancing to this Ability Level in Marksmanship characters gain access to the Calculated Shot Technique.

Calculated Shot
-
Whenever you would take an Attack Action using your Prepare Shot Technique, you also gain the benefit of your Steady Aim Technique.
This effect occurs automatically, and does not require you to spend any additiona AP.


Legend
--
A Legend in Marksmanship is normally unrivaled in the average skirmish, often able to dispatch multiple enemies with efficient and 
overwhelming firepower. 
After advancing to this Ability Level in Marksmanship characters gain access to the Dire Shot Technique.

Dire Shot (Attack)
-
This Attack Action can be made at any other time you would take an Attack Action, however you must always expend 2 AP at the time
you would use this Attack Action. (i.e. you can take a Dire Shot when making an Attack Action with your Prepare Shot Technique, 
however you must spend the additional 2 AP to activate Dire Shot when you make the attack.)

Your character's maximum Potential for this Attack Action is reduced by half (minimum 1 die), however the Attack Action gains a bonus
+3 Roll Modifier for each of the dice rolled to determine the outcome of the Attack Action.


\\\





\\\\\\\\\\

Melee Weapons (Attack, Parry)
-----
This ability represents a character's skill with close-ranged weapons used primarily for striking, thrusting, or cutting. 
Advancement in Melee Weapons typically reflects refinement of the related physical skills (e.g. hand-eye coordination, 
posturing/footwork, reflexes, etc.) as well as the character's depth of knowledge on the subject (e.g. timing/rhythm, 
point/line control, leverage).

The Melee Weapons Ability is fundamental to the Lancer Class. All Lancer's begin the game with this Ability, and have exclusive 
access to unique Secondary Abilities that become available after advancing their Melee Weapons Ability Level. Notably, Lancers 
are the only class able to use the Lancer-variant of sail-boards, allowing them to make use of their Melee Weapons Ability during
vehicular combat.

While this Ability should be useful for essentially any kind of melee weapon, a GM may choose to require a character to have some
amount of training or familiarity with a weapon before being allowed to apply their Melee Weapon Ability to rolls involving that 
weapon.

For instance, a character with a background based around fencing or some kind of one-handed bladed weapon fighting might not 
be able to make immediate use of large two-handed clubs. The GM might require the character to go through a period of familiarization
before using the weapon, or allowing the character to do so with some penalty until the character becomes familiar with the weapon.

The standard roll for Attack and Parry Actions made with this ability is Melee Weapons (Finesse + Power).

\\\


Ability Levels:

Novice
--
A Novice in Melee Weapons has learned the fundamentals of the use and maintenance of one or more melee weapons, and can readily 
recall basic information about the this field. 


Journeyman
--
A Journeyman in Melee Weapons is typically an experienced brawler and capable striker, and is capable of scoring hits on most
opponents. After advancing to this Ability Level in Melee Weapons characters gain access to the Riposte and Pressure Techniques.

Riposte
-
Whenever use your Melee Weapons Ability to successfully Parry an enemy's Melee Weapon Attack, your next Melee Weapon Attack Action 
against that target before the end of your next turn gains a +1 Roll Modifier for each of the dice rolled to determine the outcome 
of the Attack Action. You cannot gain the bonus from this Technique if you move out of melee range from your target before you 
take the Attack Action.

Pressure
-
Targets you successfully Attack with your Melee Weapons Ability have this effect applied to them automatically. Enemies affected
by this Technique have a -1 Roll Modifier on ranged attacks against you, and a -1 Roll Modifier on melee attacks aginst anyone 
other than you. This effect ends at the end of an affected character's turn, or if the affected character successfully Attacks you,
or successfully Evades or Parries one of your Attacks. 
Additionally, Enemies affected by this Technique within range of your Melee Attacks automatically provoke a Melee Weapon Ability 
Attack from you if they attempt to move out of your range. The first Attack made this way does not cost AP, however any subsequent
Attacks you would make this way cost 2 AP until the end of your next turn. 


Master
--
A Master in Melee Weapons is a proven fighter who has brushed with death several times, living by virtue of their talents and skill.
A reputable fencing school might be headed by a singular Master, and only the most prestigous can boast of employing multiple 
Masters as instructors simulatneously. 
After advancing to this Ability Level in Melee Weapons characters gain access to the Charge Technique.  

Charge
-
If you move for at least 2 meters in a straight line towards a target before making a Melee Weapons Ability Attack Action against 
them, you gain a +1 Roll Modifier for each of the dice used to determine the outcome of that Attack Action.
If you use the Charge Technique against a target, you cannot use the Charge Technique against that target again until the end of
your next turn (however, you can Charge a different target).  


Legend
--
A Legend in Melee Weapons is often capable of dispatching multiple lesser opponents at the same time without suffering as much as
a scratch. A Legend's skill might be so great as to defeat fully armed and armored opponents with little more that a sturdy stick. 
After advancing to this Ability Level in Marksmanship characters gain access to the Dire Strike Technique.

Dire Strike (Attack)
-
This Attack Action can be made at any other time you would take an Attack Action, however you must always expend 2 AP at the time
you would use this Attack Action.

Your character's maximum Potential for this Attack Action is reduced by half (minimum 1 die), however the Attack Action gains a bonus
+3 Roll Modifier for each of the dice rolled to determine the outcome of the Attack Action.

\\\\\\\\\\

Hand-to-Hand (Attack, Parry)
-----
This ability represents a character's skill when fighting without a weapon. Advancement in Hand-to-Hand typically reflects refinement
of the related physical skills (e.g. hand-eye coordination, posturing/footwork, reflexes, etc.) as well as the character's depth of 
knowledge on the subject (e.g. conditioning, training techniques, biomechanics). 

The Hand-to-Hand ability lacks the lethal potential of a proper weapon-based martial art, only dealing half the Damage of other
abilities. However, it may still be useful in a variety of situations such as a prizefight, the occassional donnybrook, or even as 
a last-ditch effort when facing an armed opponent when you're unprepared and lacking any other option but to stand your ground. 

Higher Ability Levels for this ability provide useful techniques for subduing opponents without killing them, as well as disarming
and disabling reckless foes. 

The standard roll for Attack and Parry Actions made with this ability is Hand-to-Hand (Finesse + Power).
Attack Actions made with this ability deal half Damage when successful. 
Parry Actions made with this ability increase your Defense against melee attacks by 1 instead of the normal 2.
Anytime a target's Stress would increase as a result of some Action made with this ability, their Stress increases by half of the 
regular amount (this effect cannot lower Stress inflicted below 1).


\\\


Ability Levels:

Novice
--
A Novice in Hand-to-Hand has learned the basics of punching, kicking, and blocking attacks, but lacks the proper form and confidence
to deal significant damage. Acquiring this Ability grants the character the Throw and Restrain Techniques.

Throw (Attack)
-
This Attack Action requires the character to succeed against the opponents Defense on at least 1 die and also provoke no Openings,
otherwise it fails. This Attack deals no Damage on success, instead it forces the target to make a normal Thrown Save, potentially
resulting in the target becoming Knocked Down. 

Restrain (Attack)
-
This Attack Action deals no Damage on success, instead it forces the target to make an xd6 Restrained Save where x is the number of 
successful dice rolled for this Attack Action. If the target fails, they become Restrained by you until they free themselves, or 
until you choose to or are forced to let them go. 
You can perform other Actions while restraining a target, and you can drag the target with you when you take a Move or Sprint Action.
However, your Movement Value is reduced by half, rounded down, whenever you attempt to Move or Sprint while restraining a target.
The Movement Value penalty from this Technique cannot reduce your Movement Value below 1.
If you are Knocked Down while restraining a target, you let go of them unless they are Knocked Down at the same time.

If you use your Throw Technique successfully against a target that you are actively restraining you automatically let go of the 
target, but the Thrown Save becomes xd6 instead. The x is equal to the number of dice that succeeded against the target's Defense 
during the Throw Attack roll. 


Journeyman
--
A Journeyman in Hand-to-Hand has developed respectable striking, and has started becoming more confident with riskier takedowns and
throws. After advancing to this Ability Level in Hand-to-Hand characters gain access to the Disruptive Throw and Pin Techniques.

Disruptive Throw
-
Whenever you successfully Parry an incoming melee Attack with your Hand-to-Hand Ability, you can attempt to knock down the attacker
without expending any AP or taking an Action. The Thrown Save inflicted by the this Technique requires xd6 to be rolled, where x is 
equal to the number of dice the attacker failed on during their Attack Action.

Pin (Attack)
-
This Attack Action can only be made against a target you are currently restraining with your Hand-to-Hand Ability.
This Attack Action deals no Damage on success, and instead it forces the target to make a normal Thrown Save.
If the target fails and becomes Knocked Down, you maintain your hold on them and continue to restrain them.
While the target is Knocked Down and Restrained by you, they cannot stand up and remove the Knocked Down condition without first
freeing themselves from your Restrained effect. 
You do not become Knocked Down from holding onto the target when you throw them. (Note: Openings could provide a chance for the
target to throw you at the same time.)
 

Master
--
A Master in Hand-to-Hand is an experienced combatant, and is very likely to be a capable tutor. Blows from a Master can 
theoretically kill fragile opponents. After advancing to this Ability Level in Hand-to-Hand characters gain access to the Disarm and
Subdue Techniques.
 
Disarm (Attack)
-
You cannot use this Attack Action if your current Potential for a Hand-to-Hand (Finesse + Power) roll is less than 3. 
You can only use this Attack Action whenever you successfully Parry an incoming melee Attack with your Hand-to-Hand Ability.
To do so you may spend 1 AP and make a Hand-to-Hand (Finesse + Power) Attack roll against the parried attacker, and use at least 3 
dice. This Action does not require the target to provoke an Opening first. 
This Attack Action requires you to succeed on an least 3 dice, and provoke no Openings, otherwise it fails.
If successful, this Attack deals no Damage, instead the opponent is forced to let go of the weapon or weapons they used in the 
parried Attack, which then drop to the ground at their feet. If your hands are free enough to hold any of the weapons that would be
dropped, you may choose to take them instead of letting them fall to the ground. 

Subdue (Attack)
-
You cannot use this Attack Action if your current Potential for a Hand-to-Hand (Finesse + Power) roll is less than 3. 
You may only take this Attack Action against a target that you are actively restraining with your Hand-to-Hand Ability.
This Attack Action requires you to succeed on an least 3 dice, and provoke no Openings, otherwise it fails.
If successful, this Attack deals no Damage, and instead you begin to subdue the target. This immediately ends your turn. 
You cannot take other actions while subduing the target, and the target is freed if you are hit with any Attack where at least 2 dice
succeed. If you start you turn while subduing a target, you choose whether or not to continue the Attack. If you do, you expend 2 AP 
and immediately end your turn, otherwise you free the target from the submission. 
If you end your turn by expending AP this way two times in a row you complete the submission and the target has the Unconscious 
Status applied to them.
(Note: the turn on which you took the Subue Attack Action does not count towards the turns required to complete the submission.
You must succeed on the Attack, and then pass two more turns by expending AP.)

Targets are automatically Restrained while being subdued, and must first succeed on ending the submission via an Attack as mentioned
above. The submission process does not prevent a Target from taking Attack Actions, however other Statuses or effects could be active
at the same time, preventing the target from attacking.
 

Legend
--
A Legend in Hand-to-Hand is legitimate threat to any fighter, despite the inherent recklessness of fighting unarmed. Characters of
this Ability Level can, in theory, make unarmed attacks that are damaging enough individually to inflict injuries. After advancing
to this Ability Level in Hand-to-Hand characters gain access to the Combination Throw and Rapid Submission Techniques.

Combination Throw (Attack)
--
You cannot use this Attack Action if your current Potential for a Hand-to-Hand (Finesse + Power) roll is less than 3. 
This Attack Action requires you to succeed on an least 3 dice, and provoke no Openings, otherwise it fails.
If successful, this Attack deals no Damage, instead it forces the target to make an xd6 Thrown Save, where x is the number of 
successful dice rolled for this Attack Action. Whether or not the target fails the Thrown Save, they are forced to let go of any 
weapons they are holding, which then drop to the ground at their feet. If your hands are free enough to hold any of the weapons that 
would be dropped, you may choose to take them instead of letting them fall to the ground. If the target fails the Thrown Save and you 
choose not to take the dropped weapons, you may choose to hold onto the target instead as they fall. If you choose to hold onto the 
target they are automatically Restrained by you, in addition to being Knocked Down. 
(Note: even if the target fails the Thrown Save, you may still choose to take the dropped weapons instead of restraining the target.
You are not forced to hold onto the target automatically.)

Rapid Submission
--
Whenever you succeed with your Subdue Attack Action against a Knocked Down target, you can choose to activate this Technique to 
attempt to subdue the target one turn faster. This means you can begin subduing a target and then finished the submission after 
spending 2 AP to pass during your next turn, rather than needing to do so for two turns in a row. 

Normally, Knocked Down targets cannot take Attack Actions, however targets affected by this Technique are instead allowed to make
one Attack Action against you on their turn as a final attempt to free themselves. This exception to the Knocked Down rule only 
allows the target to attack you, and only once during their turn.

\\\\\\\\\\

Engineering
-----
This ability represents a character's general scientific knowledge as well as their skill in its practical application. Engineering
in Dreyüs is incredibly advanced, and many casual technologies there would be wonders in our own world. The extremes of both the
environment and the resources of the continent means that nearly every society relies on the advanced Engineering knowledge that has 
been handed down, recovered, or discovered over Dreyüs's long history of advanced technological development. The sophistication of 
the available technology allows this ability to intersect with many practical fields, and Engineering expertise is useful in a wide
variety of situations.

Engineers are invaluable to sky-sailing crews, not only keeping the ship sailing the sky, but also able to repair the ship and keep
its systems functional while under duress. Practically every crew has a dedicated engineer on board, and larger crews may make use of 
several.

This ability is also the Primary Ability governing most uses for microfabricators. The most basic engineers have some understanding
of their use, and higher Ability Levels provide opportunities to use m-fabs in more creative and powerful ways. Most Battletechs
and Experts make heavy use of this ability thanks to this capability.

While there is no standard roll for this ability, the Acuity and Memory Attributes are the most common sources of Potential for 
rolls using Engineering. Memory represents the character's capability to understand and recall knowledge, and Acuity represents their
capability to effectively apply that knowledge. A character recalling how to fix a particular issue with a device would rely on their
Memory. A character fixing an issue by following directions might only need their Acuity. A character simultaneously recalling their
knowledge as they are diagnosing and repairing a device themself would be using both Acuity and Memory at once.   


\\\


Ability Levels:

Novice
--
A novice in Engineering has an essential understanding of the scientific principles most commonly taught among the cultures of the 
continent. They also have some familiarity with m-fabs, as well as how to make use of their flexible capabilties, albeit to a limited
degree. Acquiring this Ability grants the character the Bullet m-fab Technique.

Bullet (M-fab, Attack)
-
This Technique allows you to use an m-fab as a firearm by manufacturing a small amount of frangible material as a projectile and
enough chemical propellant to accelerate it to supersonic speeds.
You may expend 2 AP and 5 Material to make a ranged Attack Action against one target within 50m using Engineering (Finesse + Acuity). 
The projectile from this attack is very fragile, and cannot penetrate most surfaces intact, requiring you to have a direct angle 
to the target.
The m-fab absorbs the excess heat from firing the projectile, and requires a cooldown period to become cool enough to produce a 
stable product again. After using this Technique, you cannot use the m-fab for any action that requires Material to be expended.


Journeyman
--
A journeyman in Engineering is typically a reliable profesional, thouroughly familiar with most common technologies and fairly adept
with a microfabricator. Many Secondary Abilities related to in-combat uses for m-fabs become available to learn at this Ability Level. 


Master
--
A master in Engineering is often an expert in one or more fields, and is generally very adept with any technology given enough time
to study it. After advancing to this Ability Level in Engineering characters gain access to the Familiarization and Expertise 
Techniques.

Familiarization
-
This Technique can be used to study unfamiliar devices and quickly deduce their use. To do so, you must spend ten minutes studying
the device. You cannot take any other actions during this time that would break your character's focus. Actions such as eating,
drinking, or speaking are possible, but fighting, crafting, and most actions requiring an Action Roll are not possible.
After spending the required time studying the device, you uncover its primary use and how to activate it. 
You may continue studying the device with this Technique to reveal additional functions, if any are present. However, each period
of time required to discover a function is doubled from the period before it. 

(Note: You can normally attempt to discover a device's function by expending AP and making an Action Roll per your GM's discretion,
however that Action Roll might fail, potentially rendering the device useless if it is abusively mishandled. This Technique provides
a method to safely and consistently identify the function of a device, albeit with the requirement of time spent studying the device.)

The following table gives examples of the time required to reveal multiple functions: 
	
	Familiarization Time Required
	------------------------------------------------
	Function | Time Required | Total Sequential Time 
	---------|---------------|----------------------
	   1st   |  10 minutes   |    10 minutes
	   2nd   |  20 minutes   |    30 minutes
	   3rd   |  40 minutes   |    1 hour 10 minutes
	   4th   |  80 minutes   |    2 hours 30 minutes


Expertise
-
Whenever you make a non-combat Engineering Action Roll and you know another Primary Ability at Journeyman Ability Level or higher
related to action being made, you may add a +1 Roll Modifier to each of the dice rolled for that action. Examples of uses of this 
Technique include repairing a weapon or device related to a weapon skill you know, or using a medical device when your character has 
sufficient Medicine Ability Level.  


Legend
--
A legend in Engineering is able to instantly understand not only the intended functions of most technologies, but also the potential
uses outside of their original design. After advancing to this Ability Level in Engineering characters gain access to the Rigged 
Adaptation and Epic Crafter Techniques.

Rigged Adaptation
-
Whenever you would make an Engineering Action Roll to attempt to reconfigure a device to perform some function outside of its 
original purpose, you gain a +1 Roll Modifier for each dice rolled for that action. If you succeed in reconfiguring a device, its
makeshift nature does not impose any penalties to Action Rolls you make to use the device's new function.

Epic Crafter
-
Whenever you would craft a non-consumable item or device, such as a piece of equipment or a machine, with either your Engineering 
ability or any other Primary Ability that you have at Legend Ability Level, you gain a +1 Roll Modifier to any dice rolled for 
any Action Roll made for crafting. 
Whenever you finish crafting an item that activated this Technique, you may choose to make an Engineering (Acuity) roll with a 
target threshold of 12 (you may apply the Roll Modifier from this Technique to this roll, as well as any other Roll Modifiers used 
in the other crafting rolls). If this roll succeeds, the item's Item Quality modifier permanently becomes +4 instead of the normal
+3 for Legend items.        


\\\




\\\\\\\\\\

Medicine
-----
This ability represents a character's practical understanding and effective use of medical knowledge. The exact nature of this 
knowledge will largely depend on the cultural background from which a character receives training. More advanced societies make use
of formal schools and training periods, while more remote societies might rely on oral traditions and dedicated apprenticeships. 
No matter the origin of the knowledge, effective medical treatment relies on the same biological facts, and proven methods may emerge
from many sources. While a certain amount of biological knowledge is inherent to medicine, this ability does not reflect a 
character's wider understanding of Biology, which should be considered its own seperate Primary Ability. Likewise, Biology Ability 
Levels do not reflect a character's practical medical knowledge.

All captains know that a ship is a only as good as her crew, and thus universally place great value on good doctors. While human 
resilience allows men to recover from most wounds and ailments, given enough food, water, and rest. However, some wounds will never
heal on their own, and most wounds can only benefit from the careful eye of a knowing doctor. Whether maligned for their rough
handling or praised for a deft touch, all crewmates worth their salt know that their doctor is an indispensable asset.

While this Primary Ability does not grant any m-fab Techniques itself, there are several Secondary Abilities that require Ability 
Levels in both the Engineering and Medicine Primary Abilities. Medical m-fab Techniques include a powerful array of methods for 
reducing both Damage and Stress, relieving Injuries, and preventing death. A handful of Secondary Abilities even provide 
opportunities to weaponize one's medical knowledge.

Most Medicine rolls rely on Acuity, Memory, or both in combination, although occassionally other Attributes might be called for if
the situation demands it. 
Some Techniques associated with this ability make use of the Treatment Save, which is used to check if a character can effectively 
understand and treat a patient at that moment. Despite most Saves relying on a singular Attribute, the Treatment Save relies on 
the combination of your Acuity and Memory values. Similiar to how Attributes are sometimes combined to determine Potential, the 
value a character uses for the Treatment Save is equal to half of the sum of their Acuity and Memory Attributes, rounded down. Thus,
this value will range from 1 to 5, which is the normal range for Save thresholds. A Technique may call for a character to make a 
Treatment Save with one or more d6 dice, giving various results depening on how many dice roll above the combined Attribute value.

Ability Levels:

Novice
--
A novice in Medicine understands the fundamentals of how to properly treat and dress wounds, along with the other fundamentals of 
first aid. Acquiring this Ability grants the character the Stabilize Technique. 

Stabilize
-
This Technique allows the user to attempt apply the Stabilized Status to a Wounded or Dying Character without requiring access to a
Traumapak or M-fab. 

To use this Technique you expend 2 AP to begin treating the target. 

You must remain within reach of the target for the duration of the treatment, and the treatment is cancelled if the target takes 
Damage from an attack before the Stabilized Status is applied.

Each time you spend AP as part of this Technique you make a 1d6 Treatment Save, and if successful the Stabilzied Status is applied to
the target and the Technique finishes. If the Treatment Save is not successful, you can choose to end the Technique without applying 
the Status or continue the treatment. If you choose to continue the treatment your character cannot make any other actions other than 
to spend 2 AP to repeat the Treatment Save, or to end the treatment. If fail the Treatment Save twice but continue the treatment, the 
third time you spend AP the Stabilized Status is automatically applied without making the Treatment Save.

If you target yourself with this technique, the Status isn't applied automatically until after you fail 3 Treatment Saves and spend
AP a fourth time.

If you are within range to use this Technique on a target you may first expend 1 AP to make an Analysis (Acuity) roll to inspect 
their wounds more closely before treating them. The threshold for this roll is always 4. On success, the number of failed Treatment
Saves required before treatment automatically succeeds is lowered by 1. This means treating someone else can only ever require 2 
attempts total, and treating yourself can only ever require 3 attempts total if you succeed on an Analysis (Acuity) roll first. 


Journeyman
--
A journeyman in Medicine is a fairly qualified to provide general care. Many greenhorn Ship's Doctors come aboard at this Ability 
Level. After advancing to this Ability Level in Medicine characters gain access to the Enhanced Recovery Technique.

Enhanced Recovery
-
This Technique increases the effect of resting for patients under your care. Any characters resting under your medical supervision,
such as in a sick bay or hospital ward you are working in, roll d6s instead of d4s when determining the amount of Damage reduced by
their rest. 


Master
--
A master in medicine typically has a lot of practical experience in saving lives, and are often very knowledgeable in several
medical fields. After advancing to this Ability Level in Medicine characters gain access to the Life Support Technique.

Life Support
-
This Technique causes all Dying characters under your treatment, such as those with a Stabilized Status you applied or resting
in your medical facility, to automatically succeed the Death Save at the end of their turns. (Note: characters affected by this 
Technique can still die due to other means.)


Legend
--
A legend in medicine is often a once in a generation talent in their field among an advanced society, or someone who is spoken of
with semi-mythical awe for decades after their life. After advancing to this Ability Level in Medicine characters gain access to the 
Reliable Care Technique.

Reliable Care 
-
This Technique primarily affects the Stabilize Technique, reducing the number of failed attempts required before the treatment 
automatically succeeds. This Technique lowers the required number by 1, and can stack with the reduction from an Analysis (Acuity)
roll. The following table can be referenced to determined the adjusted values once this Technique is acquired:

	|-----------------------------------------------|	
	|	         Reliable Care 			|		
	|-----------------------------------------------|
	|		 |	Failed Attempts		|
	|----------------|------------------------------|
	|	Target	 |    Self     |      Other     |
	|----------------|-------------|----------------|  
	|  With Analysis |     1       |       0	|
	|----------------|-------------|----------------|
	|Without Analysis|     2       |       1	|
	|----------------|-------------|----------------|
	
      (Note: 0 Failed Attempts mean the treatment automatically applies the first time you spend AP on it.)


Whenever you use a Traumapak item on a target you automatically succeed on the Medicine (Acuity + Memory) roll.
If an m-fab Technique you use can apply the Stabilized Status, it does so automatically, regardless of any roll made for the Technique.

Additionally, your Enhanced Recovery Technique now changes the resting dice to d8s instead of d6s.

Analysis
-----
This ability represents a character's skill at observing and collecting information with their senses, as well as critically
assessing information within their head. In other words, it is their combined observation and critical thinking skills. 

This ability is fundamentally tied to the Acuity Attribute. Where the Acuity Attribute represents the character's Potential to
gather and assess information, this ability represents the character's cognitive efforts to do so. This ability is the deliberate 
behaviour a character performs, behaviours that can be learned or taught, regardless of one's biological limits. 

This ability can often interact with other Primary Abilities by giving you extra information about people and objects related
to those abilities, potentially giving bonuses for various kinds of rolls or saves. 

Rolls for this ability nearly exclusively on the Acuity Attribute for Potential, although occassionally another Attribute could be 
called for in addition if the GM thinks it is appropriate to the situation.
